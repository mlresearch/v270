title: PointPatchRL - Masked Reconstruction Improves Reinforcement Learning on Point
  Clouds
abstract: Perceiving the environment via cameras is crucial for Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) in robotics. While images are a convenient form of representation, they often
  complicate extracting important geometric details, especially with varying geometries
  or deformable objects. In contrast, point clouds naturally represent this geometry
  and easily integrate color and positional data from multiple camera views. However,
  while point-cloud processing with deep learning has seen many recent successes,
  RL on point clouds is under-researched, with only the simplest encoder architecture
  considered in the literature. We introduce PointPatchRL (PPRL), a method for RL
  on point clouds that builds on the common paradigm of dividing point clouds into
  overlapping patches, tokenizing them, and processing the tokens with transformers.
  PPRL provides significant improvements compared with other point-cloud processing
  architectures previously used for RL. We then complement PPRL with masked reconstruction
  for representation learning and show that our method outperforms strong model-free
  and model-based baselines on image observations in complex manipulation tasks containing
  deformable objects and variations in target object geometry.
