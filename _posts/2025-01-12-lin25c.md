title: Twisting Lids Off with Two Hands
abstract: Manipulating objects with two multi-fingered hands has been a long-standing
  challenge in robotics, due to the contact-rich nature of many manipulation tasks
  and the complexity inherent in coordinating a high-dimensional bimanual system.
  In this work, we share novel insights into physical modeling, real-time perception,
  and reward design that enable policies trained in simulation using deep reinforcement
  learning (RL) to be effectively and efficiently transferred to the real world. Specifically,
  we consider the problem of twisting lids of various bottle-like objects with two
  hands, demonstrating policies with generalization capabilities across a diverse
  set of unseen objects as well as dynamic and dexterous behaviors. To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first sim-to-real RL system that enables such capabilities
  on bimanual multi-fingered hands.
