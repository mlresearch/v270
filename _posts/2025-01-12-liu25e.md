title: 'Let Occ Flow: Self-Supervised 3D Occupancy Flow Prediction'
abstract: Accurate perception of the dynamic environment is a fundamental task for
  autonomous driving and robot systems. This paper introduces Let Occ Flow, the first
  self-supervised work for joint 3D occupancy and occupancy flow prediction using
  only camera inputs, eliminating the need for 3D annotations. Utilizing TPV for unified
  scene representation and deformable attention layers for feature aggregation, our
  approach incorporates a novel attention-based temporal fusion module to capture
  dynamic object dependencies, followed by a 3D refine module for fine-gained volumetric
  representation. Besides, our method extends differentiable rendering to 3D volumetric
  flow fields, leveraging zero-shot 2D segmentation and optical flow cues for dynamic
  decomposition and motion optimization. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI
  datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach over prior state-of-the-art
  methods.
