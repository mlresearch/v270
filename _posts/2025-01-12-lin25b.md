title: 'UBSoft: A Simulation Platform for Robotic Skill Learning in Unbounded Soft
  Environments'
abstract: It is desired to equip robots with the capability of interacting with various
  soft materials as they are ubiquitous in the real world. While physics simulations
  are one of the predominant methods for data collection and robot training, simulating
  soft materials presents considerable challenges. Specifically, it is significantly
  more costly than simulating rigid objects in terms of simulation speed and storage
  requirements. These limitations typically restrict the scope of studies on soft
  materials to small and bounded areas, thereby hindering the learning of skills in
  broader spaces. To address this issue, we introduce UBSoft, a new simulation platform
  designed to support unbounded soft environments for robot skill acquisition. Our
  platform utilizes spatially adaptive resolution scales, where simulation resolution
  dynamically adjusts based on proximity to active robotic agents. Our framework markedly
  reduces the demand for extensive storage space and computation costs required for
  large-scale scenarios involving soft materials. We also establish a set of benchmark
  tasks in our platform, including both locomotion and manipulation tasks, and conduct
  experiments to evaluate the efficacy of various reinforcement learning algorithms
  and trajectory optimization techniques, both gradient-based and sampling-based.
  Preliminary results indicate that sampling-based trajectory optimization generally
  achieves better results for obtaining one trajectory to solve the task. Additionally,
  we conduct experiments in real-world environments to demonstrate that advancements
  made in our UBSoft simulator could translate to improved robot interactions with
  large-scale soft material. More videos can be found at https://ubsoft24.github.io.
