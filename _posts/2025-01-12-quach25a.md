title: Gaussian Splatting to Real World Flight Navigation Transfer with Liquid Networks
abstract: Simulators are powerful tools for autonomous robot learning as they offer
  scalable data generation, flexible design, and optimization of trajectories. However,
  transferring behavior learned from simulation data into the real world proves to
  be difficult, usually mitigated with compute-heavy domain randomization methods
  or further model fine-tuning. We present a method to improve generalization and
  robustness to distribution shifts in sim-to-real visual quadrotor navigation tasks.
  To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor
  flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural
  networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines
  advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of
  expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid
  networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust
  transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the
  real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training
  environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes. Our learned
  Liquid policies, trained on single target maneuvers curated from a photorealistic
  simulated indoor flight only, generalize to multi-step hikes onboard a real hardware
  platform outdoors.
