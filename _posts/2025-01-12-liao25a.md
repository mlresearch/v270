title: Toward General Object-level Mapping from Sparse Views with 3D Diffusion Priors
abstract: Object-level mapping builds a 3D map of objects in a scene with detailed
  shapes and poses from multi-view sensor observations. Conventional methods struggle
  to build complete shapes and estimate accurate poses due to partial occlusions and
  sensor noise. They require dense observations to cover all objects, which is challenging
  to achieve in robotics trajectories. Recent work introduces generative shape priors
  for object-level mapping from sparse views, but is limited to single-category objects.
  In this work, we propose a General Object-level Mapping system, GOM, which leverages
  a 3D diffusion model as shape prior with multi-category support and outputs Neural
  Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for both texture and geometry for all objects in a scene.
  GOM includes an effective formulation to guide a pre-trained diffusion model with
  extra nonlinear constraints from sensor measurements without finetuning. We also
  develop a probabilistic optimization formulation to fuse multi-view sensor observations
  and diffusion priors for joint 3D object pose and shape estimation. Our GOM system
  demonstrates superior multi-category mapping performance from sparse views, and
  achieves more accurate mapping results compared to state-of-the-art methods on the
  real-world benchmarks. We will release our code and model upon publication.
