title: 'ManiWAV: Learning Robot Manipulation from In-the-Wild Audio-Visual Data'
abstract: 'Audio signals provide rich information for the robot interaction and object
  properties through contact. These information can surprisingly ease the learning
  of contact-rich robot manipulation skills, especially when the visual information
  alone is ambiguous or incomplete. However, the usage of audio data in robot manipulation
  has been constrained to teleoperated demonstrations collected by either attaching
  a microphone to the robot or object, which significantly limits its usage in robot
  learning pipelines. In this work, we introduce ManiWAV: an ’ear-in-hand’ data collection
  device to collect in-the-wild human demonstrations with synchronous audio and visual
  feedback, and a corresponding policy interface to learn robot manipulation policy
  directly from the demonstrations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system
  through four contact-rich manipulation tasks that require either passively sensing
  the contact events and modes, or actively sensing the object surface materials and
  states. In addition, we show that our system can generalize to unseen in-the-wild
  environments, by learning from diverse in-the-wild human demonstrations. All data,
  code, and policy will be public.'
