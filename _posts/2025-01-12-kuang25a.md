title: 'RAM: Retrieval-Based Affordance Transfer for Generalizable Zero-Shot Robotic
  Manipulation'
abstract: This work proposes a retrieve-and-transfer framework for zero-shot robotic
  manipulation, dubbed RAM, featuring generalizability across various objects, environments,
  and embodiments. Unlike existing approaches that learn manipulation from expensive
  in-domain demonstrations, RAM capitalizes on a retrieval-based affordance transfer
  paradigm to acquire versatile manipulation capabilities from abundant out-of-domain
  data. RAM first extracts unified affordance at scale from diverse sources of demonstrations
  including robotic data, human-object interaction (HOI) data, and custom data to
  construct a comprehensive affordance memory. Then given a language instruction,
  RAM hierarchically retrieves the most similar demonstration from the affordance
  memory and transfers such out-of-domain 2D affordance to in-domain 3D actionable
  affordance in a zero-shot and embodiment-agnostic manner. Extensive simulation and
  real-world evaluations demonstrate that our RAM consistently outperforms existing
  works in diverse daily tasks. Additionally, RAM shows significant potential for
  downstream applications such as automatic and efficient data collection, one-shot
  visual imitation, and LLM/VLM-integrated long-horizon manipulation.
