title: 'Play to the Score: Stage-Guided Dynamic Multi-Sensory Fusion for Robotic Manipulation'
abstract: 'Humans possess a remarkable talent for flexibly alternating to different
  senses when interacting with the environment. Picture a chef skillfully gauging
  the timing of ingredient additions and controlling the heat according to the colors,
  sounds, and aromas, seamlessly navigating through every stage of the complex cooking
  process. This ability is founded upon a thorough comprehension of task stages, as
  achieving the sub-goal within each stage can necessitate the utilization of different
  senses. In order to endow robots with similar ability, we incorporate the task stages
  divided by sub-goals into the imitation learning process to accordingly guide dynamic
  multi-sensory fusion. We propose MS-Bot, a stage-guided dynamic multi-sensory fusion
  method with coarse-to-fine stage understanding, which dynamically adjusts the priority
  of modalities based on the fine-grained state within the predicted current stage.
  We train a robot system equipped with visual, auditory, and tactile sensors to accomplish
  challenging robotic manipulation tasks: pouring and peg insertion with keyway. Experimental
  results indicate that our approach enables more effective and explainable dynamic
  fusion, aligning more closely with the human fusion process than existing methods.'
