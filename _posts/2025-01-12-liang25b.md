title: 'Dreamitate: Real-World Visuomotor Policy Learning via Video Generation'
abstract: A key challenge in manipulation is learning a policy that can robustly generalize
  to diverse visual environments. A promising mechanism for learning robust policies
  is to leverage video generative models, which are pretrained on large-scale datasets
  of internet videos. In this paper, we propose a visuomotor policy learning framework
  that fine-tunes a video diffusion model on human demonstrations of a given task.
  At test time, we generate an example of an execution of the task conditioned on
  images of a novel scene, and use this synthesized execution directly to control
  the robot. Our key insight is that using common tools allows us to effortlessly
  bridge the embodiment gap between the human hand and the robot manipulator. We evaluate
  our approach on 4 tasks of increasing complexity and demonstrate that capitalizing
  on internet-scale generative models allows the learned policy to achieve a significantly
  higher degree of generalization than existing behavior cloning approaches.
