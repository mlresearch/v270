title: 'CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications'
abstract: Autonomous robot operation in unstructured environments is often underpinned
  by spatial understanding through vision. Systems composed of multiple concurrently
  operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable
  pose estimates. Classical vision-based methods to regress relative pose are commonly
  computationally expensive (precluding real-time applications), and often lack data-derived
  priors for resolving ambiguities. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative,
  multi-robot visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data,
  enabling pose estimation as well as general spatial comprehension. Our model is
  fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute,
  and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative
  pose estimates and a local birdâ€™s-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera
  overlap between robots, and can predict BEV representations of unseen regions. We
  demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world
  settings. We provide supplementary material online and will open source our trained
  model in due course. https://sites.google.com/view/covis-net
