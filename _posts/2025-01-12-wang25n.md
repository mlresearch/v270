title: 'EscIRL: Evolving Self-Contrastive IRL for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous
  Driving'
abstract: While deep neural networks (DNN) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)
  have both been commonly used in autonomous driving to predict trajectories through
  learning from expert demonstrations, DNN-based methods suffer from data-scarcity,
  while IRL-based approaches often struggle with generalizability, making both hard
  to apply to new driving scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce EscIRL,
  a novel decoupled bi-level training framework that iteratively learns robust reward
  models from only a few mixed-scenario demonstrations. At the inner level, EscIRL
  introduces a self-contrastive IRL module that learns a spectrum of specialized reward
  functions by contrasting demonstrations across different scenarios. At the outer
  level, ESCIRL employs an evolving loop that iteratively refines the contrastive
  sets, ensuring global convergence. Experiments on two multi-scenario datasets, CitySim
  and INTERACTION, demonstrate the effectiveness of EscIRL, outperforming state-of-the-art
  DNN and IRL-based methods by 41.3% on average. Notably, we show that EscIRL achieves
  superior generalizability compared to DNN-based approaches while requiring only
  a small fraction of the data, effectively addressing data-scarcity constraints.
