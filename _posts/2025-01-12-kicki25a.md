title: Bridging the gap between Learning-to-plan, Motion Primitives and Safe Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: Trajectory planning under kinodynamic constraints is fundamental for advanced
  robotics applications that require dexterous, reactive, and rapid skills in complex
  environments. These constraints, which may represent task, safety, or actuator limitations,
  are essential for ensuring the proper functioning of robotic platforms and preventing
  unexpected behaviors. Recent advances in kinodynamic planning demonstrate that learning-to-plan
  techniques can generate complex and reactive motions under intricate constraints.
  However, these techniques necessitate the analytical modeling of both the robot
  and the entire task, a limiting assumption when systems are extremely complex or
  when constructing accurate task models is prohibitive. This paper addresses this
  limitation by combining learning-to-plan methods with reinforcement learning, resulting
  in a novel integration of black-box learning of motion primitives and optimization.
  We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art safe reinforcement learning methods,
  showing that our technique, particularly when exploiting task structure, outperforms
  baseline methods in challenging scenarios such as planning to hit in robot air hockey.
  This work demonstrates the potential of our integrated approach to enhance the performance
  and safety of robots operating under complex kinodynamic constraints.
