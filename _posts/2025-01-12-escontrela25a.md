title: Learning Robotic Locomotion Affordances and Photorealistic Simulators from
  Human-Captured Data
abstract: 'Learning reliable affordance models which satisfy human preferences is
  often hindered by a lack of high-quality training data. Similarly, learning visuomotor
  policies in simulation can be challenging due to the high cost of photo-realistic
  rendering. We present PAWS: a comprehensive robot learning framework that uses a
  novel portable data capture rig and processing pipeline to collect long-horizon
  trajectories that include camera poses, foot poses, terrain meshes, and 3D radiance
  fields. We also contribute PAWS-Data: an extensive dataset gathered with PAWS containing
  over 10 hours of indoor and outdoor trajectories spanning a variety of scenes. With
  PAWS-Data we leverage radiance fieldsâ€™ photo-realistic rendering to generate tens
  of thousands of viewpoint-augmented images, then produce pixel affordance labels
  by identifying semantically similar regions to those traversed by the user. On this
  data we finetune a navigation affordance model from a pretrained backbone, and perform
  detailed ablations. Additionally, We open source PAWS-Sim, a high-speed photo-realistic
  simulator which integrates PAWS-Data with IsaacSim, enabling research for visuomotor
  policy learning. We evaluate the utility of the affordance model on a quadrupedal
  robot, which plans through affordances to follow pathways and sidewalks, and avoid
  human collisions. Project resources are available on the [website](https://pawslocomotion.com).'
