title: 'Teaching Robots with Show and Tell: Using Foundation Models to Synthesize
  Robot Policies from Language and Visual Demonstration'
abstract: We introduce a modular, neuro-symbolic framework for teaching robots new
  skills through language and visual demonstration. Our approach, ShowTell, composes
  a mixture of foundation models to synthesize robot manipulation programs that are
  easy to interpret and generalize across a wide range of tasks and environments.
  ShowTell is designed to handle complex demonstrations involving high level logic
  such as loops and conditionals while being intuitive and natural for end-users.
  We validate this approach through a series of real-world robot experiments, showing
  that ShowTell out-performs a state-of-the-art baseline based on GPT4-V, on a variety
  of tasks, and that it is able to generalize to unseen environments and within category
  objects.
