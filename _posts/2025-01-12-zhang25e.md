title: 'Tag Map: A Text-Based Map for Spatial Reasoning and Navigation with Large
  Language Models'
abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as a tool for robots to generate
  task plans using common sense reasoning. For the LLM to generate actionable plans,
  scene context must be provided, often through a map. Recent works have shifted from
  explicit maps with fixed semantic classes to implicit open vocabulary maps based
  on queryable embeddings capable of representing any semantic class. However, embeddings
  cannot directly report the scene context as they are implicit, requiring further
  processing for LLM integration. To address this, we propose an explicit text-based
  map that can represent thousands of semantic classes while easily integrating with
  LLMs due to their text-based nature by building upon large-scale image recognition
  models. We study how entities in our map can be localized and show through evaluations
  that our text-based map localizations perform comparably to those from open vocabulary
  maps while using two to four orders of magnitude less memory. Real-robot experiments
  demonstrate the grounding of an LLM with the text-based map to solve user tasks.
