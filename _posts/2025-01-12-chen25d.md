title: Differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods for Real-Time Modeling of Deformable Linear
  Objects
abstract: This paper addresses the task of modeling Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs),
  such as ropes and cables, during dynamic motion over long time horizons. This task
  presents significant challenges due to the complex dynamics of DLOs. To address
  these challenges, this paper proposes differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods For deformable
  linear Objects with Real-time Modeling (DEFORM), a novel framework that combines
  a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to model DLOs accurately
  and in real-time. The performance of DEFORM is evaluated in an experimental setup
  involving two industrial robots and a variety of sensors. A comprehensive series
  of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of DEFORM in terms of accuracy, computational
  speed, and generalizability when compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. To further
  demonstrate the utility of DEFORM, this paper integrates it into a perception pipeline
  and illustrates its superior performance when compared to the state-of-the-art methods
  while tracking a DLO even in the presence of occlusions. Finally, this paper illustrates
  the superior performance of DEFORM when compared to state-of-the-art methods when
  it is applied to perform autonomous planning and control of DLOs.
