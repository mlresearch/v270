title: 'Learning to Manipulate Anywhere: A Visual Generalizable Framework For Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: Can we endow visuomotor robots with generalization capabilities to operate
  in diverse open-world scenarios? In this paper, we propose Maniwhere, a generalizable
  framework tailored for visual reinforcement learning, enabling the trained robot
  policies to generalize across a combination of multiple visual disturbance types.
  Specifically, we introduce a multi-view representation learning approach fused with
  Spatial Transformer Network (STN) module to capture shared semantic information
  and correspondences among different viewpoints. In addition, we employ a curriculum-based
  randomization and augmentation approach to stabilize the RL training process and
  strengthen the visual generalization ability. To exhibit the effectiveness of Maniwhere,
  we meticulously design **8** tasks encompassing articulate objects, bi-manual, and
  dexterous hand manipulation tasks, demonstrating Maniwhereâ€™s strong visual generalization
  and sim2real transfer abilities across **3** hardware platforms. Our experiments
  show that Maniwhere significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
