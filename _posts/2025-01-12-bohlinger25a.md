title: 'One Policy to Run Them All: an End-to-end Learning Approach to Multi-Embodiment
  Locomotion'
abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results
  in robust legged locomotion. While there exists a wide variety of legged platforms
  such as quadruped, humanoids, and hexapods, the field is still missing a single
  learning framework that can control all these different embodiments easily and effectively
  and possibly transfer, zero or few-shot, to unseen robot embodiments. To close this
  gap, we introduce URMA, the Unified Robot Morphology Architecture. Our framework
  brings the end-to-end Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning approach to the realm of
  legged robots, enabling the learned policy to control any type of robot morphology.
  The key idea of our method is to allow the network to learn an abstract locomotion
  controller that can be seamlessly shared between embodiments thanks to our morphology-agnostic
  encoders and decoders. This flexible architecture can be seen as a first step in
  building a foundation model for legged robot locomotion. Our experiments show that
  URMA can learn a locomotion policy on multiple embodiments that can be easily transferred
  to unseen robot platforms in simulation and the real world.
