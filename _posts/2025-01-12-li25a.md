title: 'OKAMI: Teaching Humanoid Robots Manipulation Skills through Single Video Imitation'
abstract: We study the problem of teaching humanoid robots manipulation skills by
  imitating from single video demonstrations. We introduce OKAMI, a method that generates
  a manipulation plan from a single RGB-D video and derives a policy for execution.
  At the heart of our approach is object-aware retargeting, which enables the humanoid
  robot to mimic the human motions in an RGB-D video while adjusting to different
  object locations during deployment. OKAMI uses open-world vision models to identify
  task-relevant objects and retarget the body motions and hand poses separately. Our
  experiments show that OKAMI achieves strong generalizations across varying visual
  and spatial conditions, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline on open-world
  imitation from observation. Furthermore, OKAMI rollout trajectories are leveraged
  to train closed-loop visuomotor policies, which achieve an average success rate
  of $79.2%$ without the need for labor-intensive teleoperation. More videos can be
  found on our website https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/OKAMI/.
