title: 'CtRL-Sim: Reactive and Controllable Driving Agents with Offline Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: Evaluating autonomous vehicle stacks (AVs) in simulation typically involves
  replaying driving logs from real-world recorded traffic. However, agents replayed
  from offline data are not reactive and hard to intuitively control. Existing approaches
  address these challenges by proposing methods that rely on heuristics or generative
  models of real-world data but these approaches either lack realism or necessitate
  costly iterative sampling procedures to control the generated behaviours. In this
  work, we take an alternative approach and propose CtRL-Sim, a method that leverages
  return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning to efficiently generate reactive
  and controllable traffic agents. Specifically, we process real-world driving data
  through a physics-enhanced Nocturne simulator to generate a diverse offline reinforcement
  learning dataset, annotated with various reward terms. We then train a return-conditioned
  multi-agent behaviour model that allows for fine-grained manipulation of agent behaviours
  by modifying the desired returns for the various reward components. This capability
  enables the generation of a wide range of driving behaviours beyond the scope of
  the initial dataset, including adversarial behaviours. We demonstrate that CtRL-Sim
  can generate diverse and realistic safety-critical scenarios while providing fine-grained
  control over agent behaviours.
