title: Task-Oriented Hierarchical Object Decomposition for Visuomotor Control
abstract: 'Good pre-trained visual representations could enable robots to learn visuomotor
  policy efficiently. Still, existing representations take a one-size-fits-all-tasks
  approach that comes with two important drawbacks: (1) Being completely task-agnostic,
  these representations cannot effectively ignore any task-irrelevant information
  in the scene, and (2) They often lack the representational capacity to handle unconstrained/complex
  real-world scenes. Instead, we propose to train a large combinatorial family of
  representations organized by scene entities: objects and object parts. This hierarchical
  object decomposition for task-oriented representations (HODOR) permits selectively
  assembling different representations specific to each task while scaling in representational
  capacity with the complexity of the scene and the task. In our experiments, we find
  that HODOR outperforms prior pre-trained representations, both scene vector representations
  and object-centric representations, for sample-efficient imitation learning across
  5 simulated and 5 real-world manipulation tasks. We further find that the invariances
  captured in HODOR are inherited into downstream policies, which can robustly generalize
  to out-of-distribution test conditions, permitting zero-shot skill chaining. Appendix
