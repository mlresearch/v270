title: Modeling Drivers’ Situational Awareness from Eye Gaze for Driving Assistance
abstract: 'Intelligent driving assistance can alert drivers to objects in their environment;
  however, such systems require a model of drivers’ situational awareness (SA) (what
  aspects of the scene they are already aware of) to avoid unnecessary alerts. Moreover,
  collecting the data to train such an SA model is challenging: being an internal
  human cognitive state, driver SA is difficult to measure, and non-verbal signals
  such as eye gaze are some of the only outward manifestations of it. Traditional
  methods to obtain SA labels rely on probes that result in sparse, intermittent SA
  labels unsuitable for modeling a dense, temporally correlated process via machine
  learning. We propose a novel interactive labeling protocol that captures dense,
  continuous SA labels and use it to collect an object-level SA dataset in a VR driving
  simulator. Our dataset comprises 20 unique drivers’ SA labels, driving data, and
  gaze (over 320 minutes of driving) which will be made public. Additionally, we train
  an SA model from this data, formulating the object-level driver SA prediction problem
  as a semantic segmentation problem. Our formulation allows all objects in a scene
  at a timestep to be processed simultaneously, leveraging global scene context and
  local gaze-object relationships together. Our experiments show that this formulation
  leads to improved performance over common sense baselines and prior art on the SA
  prediction task.'
