title: In-Flight Attitude Control of a Quadruped using Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We present the development and real world demonstration of an in-flight
  attitude control law for a small low-cost quadruped with a five-bar-linkage leg
  design using only its legs as reaction masses. The control law is trained using
  deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and specifically through Proximal Policy Optimization
  (PPO) in the NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim simulator with a GPU-accelerated DRL pipeline.
  To demonstrate the policy, a small quadruped is designed, constructed, and evaluated
  both on a rotating pole test setup and in free fall. During a free fall of 0.7 seconds,
  the quadruped follows commanded attitude steps of 45 degrees in all principal axes,
  and achieves an average base angular velocity of 110 degrees per second during large
  attitude reference steps.
