title: 'MBC: Multi-Brain Collaborative Control for Quadruped Robots'
abstract: In the field of locomotion task of quadruped robots, Blind Policy and Perceptive
  Policy each have their own advantages and limitations. The Blind Policy relies on
  preset sensor information and algorithms, suitable for known and structured environments,
  but it lacks adaptability in complex or unknown environments. The Perceptive Policy
  uses visual sensors to obtain detailed environmental information, allowing it to
  adapt to complex terrains, but its effectiveness is limited under occluded conditions,
  especially when perception fails. Unlike the Blind Policy, the Perceptive Policy
  is not as robust under these conditions. To address these challenges, we propose
  a MBC:Multi-Brain collaborative system that incorporates the concepts of Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning and introduces collaboration between the Blind Policy and
  the Perceptive Policy. By applying this multi-policy collaborative model to a quadruped
  robot, the robot can maintain stable locomotion even when the perceptual system
  is impaired or observational data is incomplete. Our simulations and real-world
  experiments demonstrate that this system significantly improves the robotâ€™s passability
  and robustness against perception failures in complex environments, validating the
  effectiveness of multi-policy collaboration in enhancing robotic motion performance.
