title: Discovering Robotic Interaction Modes with Discrete Representation Learning
abstract: 'Abstract: Human actions manipulating articulated objects, such as opening
  and closing a drawer, can be categorized into multiple modalities we define as interaction
  modes. Traditional robot learning approaches lack discrete representations of these
  modes, which are crucial for empirical sampling and grounding. In this paper, we
  present ActAIM2, which learns a discrete representation of robot manipulation interaction
  modes in a purely unsupervised fashion, without the use of expert labels or simulator-based
  privileged information. Utilizing novel data collection methods involving simulator
  rollouts, ActAIM2 consists of an interaction mode selector and a low-level action
  predictor. The selector generates discrete representations of potential interaction
  modes with self-supervision, while the predictor outputs corresponding action trajectories.
  Our method is validated through its success rate in manipulating articulated objects
  and its robustness in sampling meaningful actions from the discrete representation.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate ActAIM2â€™s effectiveness in enhancing manipulability
  and generalizability over baselines and ablation studies. For videos and additional
  results, see our website: https://actaim2.github.io/.'
