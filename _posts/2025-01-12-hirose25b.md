title: 'LeLaN: Learning A Language-Conditioned Navigation Policy from In-the-Wild
  Video'
abstract: We present our method, LeLaN, which uses action-free egocentric data to
  learn robust language-conditioned object navigation. By leveraging the knowledge
  of large vision and language models and grounding this knowledge using pre-trained
  segmentation and depth estimation models, we can label in-the-wild data from a variety
  of indoor and outdoor environments with diverse instructions that capture a range
  of objects with varied granularity and noise in their descriptions. Leveraging this
  method to label over 50 hours of data collected in indoor and outdoor environments,
  including robot observations, YouTube video tours, and human-collected walking data
  allows us to train a policy that can outperform state-of-the-art methods on the
  zero-shot object navigation task in both success rate and precision.
