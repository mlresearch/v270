title: Context-Aware Replanning with Pre-Explored Semantic Map for Object Navigation
abstract: Pre-explored Semantic Map, constructed through prior exploration using visual
  language models (VLMs), has proven effective as a foundational element for training-free
  robotic applications. However, existing approaches assume the mapâ€™s accuracy and
  do not provide effective mechanisms for revising decisions based on incorrect maps.
  This work introduces Context-Aware Replanning (CARe),, which estimates map uncertainty
  through confidence scores and multi-view consistency, enabling the agent to revise
  erroneous decisions stemming from inaccurate maps without additional labels. We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using two modern map backbones,
  VLMaps and OpenMask3D, and show significant improvements in performance on object
  navigation tasks.
