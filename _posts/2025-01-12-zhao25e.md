title: Accelerating Visual Sparse-Reward Learning with Latent Nearest-Demonstration-Guided
  Explorations
abstract: Recent progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL) and computer vision
  enables artificial agents to solve complex tasks, including locomotion, manipulation,
  and video games from high-dimensional pixel observations. However, RL usually relies
  on domain-specific reward functions for sufficient learning signals, requiring expert
  knowledge. While vision-based agents could learn skills from only sparse rewards,
  exploration challenges arise. We present Latent Nearest-demonstration-guided Exploration
  (LaNE), a novel and efficient method to solve sparse-reward robot manipulation tasks
  from image observations and a few demonstrations. First, LaNE builds on the pre-trained
  DINOv2 feature extractor to learn an embedding space for forward prediction. Next,
  it rewards the agent for exploring near the demos, quantified by quadratic control
  costs in the embedding space. Finally, LaNE optimizes the policy for the augmented
  rewards with RL. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
  sample efficiency in Robosuite simulation and enables under-an-hour RL training
  from scratch on a Franka Panda robot, using only a few demonstrations.
