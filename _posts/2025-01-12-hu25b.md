title: 'OrbitGrasp: SE(3)-Equivariant Grasp Learning'
abstract: While grasp detection is an important part of any robotic manipulation pipeline,
  reliable and accurate grasp detection in $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ remains a research challenge.
  Many robotics applications in unstructured environments such as the home or warehouse
  would benefit a lot from better grasp performance. This paper proposes a novel framework
  for detecting $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ grasp poses based on point cloud input. Our main
  contribution is to propose an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariant model that maps each
  point in the cloud to a continuous grasp quality function over the 2-sphere $S^2$
  using a spherical harmonic basis. Compared with reasoning about a finite set of
  samples, this formulation improves the accuracy and efficiency of our model when
  a large number of samples would otherwise be needed. In order to accomplish this,
  we propose a novel variation on EquiFormerV2 that leverages a UNet-style backbone
  to enlarge the number of points the model can handle. Our resulting method, which
  we name OrbitGrasp, significantly outperforms baselines in both simulation and physical
  experiments.
