title: Shelf-Supervised Cross-Modal Pre-Training for 3D Object Detection
abstract: State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are often trained on massive labeled
  datasets. However, annotating 3D bounding boxes remains prohibitively expensive
  and time-consuming, particularly for LiDAR. Instead, recent works demonstrate that
  self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled data can improve detection accuracy
  with limited labels. Contemporary methods adapt best-practices for self-supervised
  learning from the image domain to point clouds (such as contrastive learning). However,
  publicly available 3D datasets are considerably smaller and less diverse than those
  used for image-based self-supervised learning, limiting their effectiveness. We
  do note, however, that such data is naturally collected in a multimodal fashion,
  often paired with images. Rather than pre-training with only self-supervised objectives,
  we argue that it is better to bootstrap point cloud representations using image-based
  foundation models trained on internet-scale image data. Specifically, we propose
  a shelf-supervised approach (e.g. supervised with off-the-shelf image foundation
  models) for generating zero-shot 3D bounding boxes from paired RGB and LiDAR data.
  Pre-training 3D detectors with such pseudo-labels yields significantly better semi-supervised
  detection accuracy than prior self-supervised pretext tasks. Importantly, we show
  that image-based shelf-supervision is helpful for training LiDAR-only and multi-modal
  (RGB + LiDAR) detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on nuScenes
  and WOD, significantly improving over prior work in limited data settings.
