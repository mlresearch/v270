title: Promptable Closed-loop Traffic Simulation
abstract: Simulation stands as a cornerstone for safe and efficient autonomous driving
  development. At its core a simulation system ought to produce realistic, reactive,
  and controllable traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ProSim, a multimodal
  promptable closed-loop traffic simulation framework. ProSim allows the user to give
  a complex set of numerical, categorical or textual prompts to instruct each agent’s
  behavior and intention. ProSim then rolls out a traffic scenario in a closed-loop
  manner, modeling each agent’s interaction with other traffic participants. Our experiments
  show that ProSim achieves high prompt controllability given different user prompts,
  while reaching competitive performance on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge when no
  prompt is given. To support research on promptable traffic simulation, we create
  ProSim-Instruct-520k, a multimodal prompt-scenario paired driving dataset with over
  10M text prompts for over 520k real-world driving scenarios. We will release data,
  benchmark, and labeling tools of ProSim-Instruct-520k upon publication.
