title: Conformal Prediction for Semantically-Aware Autonomous Perception in Urban
  Environments
abstract: 'We introduce Knowledge-Refined Prediction Sets (KRPS), a novel approach
  that performs semantically-aware uncertainty quantification for multitask-based
  autonomous perception in urban environments. KRPS extends conformal prediction (CP)
  to ensure 2 properties not typically addressed by CP frameworks: semantic label
  consistency and true label coverage, across multiple perception tasks. We elucidate
  the capability of KRPS through high-level classification tasks crucial for semantically-aware
  autonomous perception in urban environments, including agent classification, agent
  location classification, and agent action classification. In a theoretical analysis,
  we introduce the concept of semantic label consistency among tasks and prove the
  semantic consistency and marginal coverage properties of the produced sets by KRPS.
  The results of our evaluation on the ROAD dataset and the Waymo/ROAD++ dataset show
  that KRPS outperforms state-of-the-art CP methods in reducing uncertainty by up
  to 80% and increasing the semantic consistency by up to 30%, while maintaining the
  coverage guarantees.'
