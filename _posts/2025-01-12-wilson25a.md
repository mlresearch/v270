title: What Matters in Range View 3D Object Detection
abstract: 'Lidar-based perception pipelines rely on 3D object detection models to
  interpret complex scenes. While multiple representations for lidar exist, the range
  view is enticing since it losslessly encodes the entire lidar sensor output. In
  this work, we achieve state-of-the-art amongst range view 3D object detection models
  without using multiple techniques proposed in past range view literature. We explore
  range view 3D object detection across two modern datasets with substantially different
  properties: Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open. Our investigation reveals key insights:
  (1) input feature dimensionality significantly influences the overall performance,
  (2) surprisingly, employing a classification loss grounded in 3D spatial proximity
  works as well or better compared to more elaborate IoU-based losses, and (3) addressing
  non-uniform lidar density via a straightforward range subsampling technique outperforms
  existing multi-resolution, range-conditioned networks. Our experiments reveal that
  techniques proposed in recent range view literature are not needed to achieve state-of-the-art
  performance. Combining the above findings, we establish a new state-of-the-art model
  for range view 3D object detection â€” improving AP by 2.2% on the Waymo Open dataset
  while maintaining a runtime of 10 Hz. We are the first to benchmark a range view
  model on the Argoverse 2 dataset and outperform strong voxel-based baselines. All
  models are multi-class and open-source. Code is available at https://github.com/benjaminrwilson/range-view-3d-detection.'
