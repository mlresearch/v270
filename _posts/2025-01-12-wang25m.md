title: 'GenDP: 3D Semantic Fields for Category-Level Generalizable Diffusion Policy'
abstract: 'Diffusion-based policies have shown remarkable capability in executing
  complex robotic manipulation tasks but lack explicit characterization of geometry
  and semantics, which often limits their ability to generalize to unseen objects
  and layouts. To enhance the generalization capabilities of Diffusion Policy, we
  introduce a novel framework that incorporates explicit spatial and semantic information
  via 3D semantic fields. We generate 3D descriptor fields from multi-view RGBD observations
  with large foundational vision models, then compare these descriptor fields against
  reference descriptors to obtain semantic fields. The proposed method explicitly
  considers geometry and semantics, enabling strong generalization capabilities in
  tasks requiring category-level generalization, resolving geometric ambiguities,
  and attention to subtle geometric details. We evaluate our method across eight tasks
  involving articulated objects and instances with varying shapes and textures from
  multiple object categories. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness by increasing
  Diffusion Policyâ€™s average success rate on \textit{unseen} instances from 20% to
  93%. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis and visualization to interpret
  the sources of performance gain and explain how our method can generalize to novel
  instances. Project page: https://robopil.github.io/GenDP/'
