title: 'Real-to-Sim Grasp: Rethinking the Gap between Simulation and Real World in
  Grasp Detection'
abstract: For 6-DoF grasp detection, simulated data is expandable to train more powerful
  model, but it faces the challenge of the large gap between simulation and real world.
  Previous works bridge this gap with a sim-to-real way. However, this way explicitly
  or implicitly forces the simulated data to adapt to the noisy real data when training
  grasp detectors, where the positional drift and structural distortion within the
  camera noise will harm the grasp learning. In this work, we propose a Real-to-Sim
  framework for 6-DoF Grasp detection, named R2SGrasp, with the key insight of bridging
  this gap in a real-to-sim way, which directly bypasses the camera noise in grasp
  detector training through an inference-time real-to-sim adaption. To achieve this
  real-to-sim adaptation, our R2SGrasp designs the Real-to-Sim Data Repairer (R2SRepairer)
  to mitigate the camera noise of real depth maps in data-level, and the Real-to-Sim
  Feature Enhancer (R2SEnhancer) to enhance real features with precise simulated geometric
  primitives in feature-level. To endow our framework with the generalization ability,
  we construct a large-scale simulated dataset cost-efficiently to train our grasp
  detector, which includes 64,000 RGB-D images with 14.4 million grasp annotations.
  Sufficient experiments show that R2SGrasp is powerful and our real-to-sim perspective
  is effective. The real-world experiments further show great generalization ability
  of R2SGrasp. Project page is available on https://isee-laboratory.github.io/R2SGrasp.
