title: Task Success Prediction for Open-Vocabulary Manipulation Based on Multi-Level
  Aligned Representations
abstract: 'In this study, we consider the problem of predicting task success for open-vocabulary
  manipulation by a manipulator, based on instruction sentences and egocentric images
  before and after manipulation. Conventional approaches, including multimodal large
  language models (MLLMs), often fail to appropriately understand detailed characteristics
  of objects and/or subtle changes in the position of objects. We propose Contrastive
  $\lambda$-Repformer, which predicts task success for table-top manipulation tasks
  by aligning images with instruction sentences. Our method integrates the following
  three key types of features into a multi-level aligned representation: features
  that preserve local image information; features aligned with natural language; and
  features structured through natural language. This allows the model to focus on
  important changes by looking at the differences in the representation between two
  images. We evaluate Contrastive $\lambda$-Repformer on a dataset based on a large-scale
  standard dataset, the RT-1 dataset, and on a physical robot platform. The results
  show that our approach outperformed existing approaches including MLLMs. Our best
  model achieved an improvement of 8.66 points in accuracy compared to the representative
  MLLM-based model.'
