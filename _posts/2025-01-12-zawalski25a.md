title: Robotic Control via Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
abstract: A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability to
  generalize outside their training data. Recent works on vision-language-action models
  (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models
  as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness
  and generalization ability. Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large
  vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through
  complex problems. Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies
  to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use
  of “chain-of-thought” (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with
  standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available
  to them. Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in
  regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning
  in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, we introduce Embodied
  Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple
  steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features
  like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot
  action. We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for
  ECoT on large robot datasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success
  rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% across challenging
  generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data. Additionally,
  ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy’s failures and correct its
  behavior using natural language.
