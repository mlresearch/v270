title: 'DiffusionSeeder: Seeding Motion Optimization with Diffusion for Rapid Motion
  Planning'
abstract: Running optimization across many parallel seeds leveraging GPU compute [2]
  have relaxed the need for a good initialization, but this can fail if the problem
  is highly non-convex as all seeds could get stuck in local minima. One such setting
  is collision-free motion optimization for robot manipulation, where optimization
  converges quickly on easy problems but struggle in obstacle dense environments (e.g.,
  a cluttered cabinet or table). In these situations, graph based planning algorithms
  are called to obtain seeds, resulting significant slowdowns. We propose DiffusionSeeder,
  a diffusion based approach that generates trajectories to seed motion optimization
  for rapid robot motion planning. DiffusionSeeder takes the initial depth image observation
  of the scene and generates high quality, multi-modal trajectories that are then
  fine-tuned with few iterations of motion optimization. We integrated DiffusionSeeder
  with cuRobo, a GPU-accelerated motion optimization method, to generate the seed
  trajectories which results in 12x speed up on average, and 36x speed up for more
  complicated problems, while achieving 10% higher success rate in partially observed
  simulation environments. Our results prove the effectiveness of using diverse solutions
  from learned diffusion model. Physical experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate
  the sim2real transfer of DiffusionSeeder to the real robot, with an average success
  rate of 86% and planning time of 26ms, increasing on cuRobo by 51% higher success
  rate and 2.5x speed up. The code and the model weights will be available after publication.
