title: 'MOSAIC: Modular Foundation Models for Assistive and Interactive Cooking'
abstract: 'We present MOSAIC, a modular architecture for coordinating multiple robots
  to (a) interact with users using natural language and (b) manipulate an open vocabulary
  of everyday objects. At several levels, MOSAIC employs modularity: it leverages
  multiple large-scale pre-trained models for high-level tasks like language and image
  recognition, while using streamlined modules designed for low-level task-specific
  control. This decomposition allows us to reap the complementary benefits of foundation
  models and precise, more specialized models, enabling our system to scale to complex
  tasks that involve coordinating multiple robots and humans. First, we unit-test
  individual modules with 180 episodes of visuomotor picking, 60 episodes of human
  motion forecasting, and 46 online user evaluations of the task planner. We then
  extensively evaluate MOSAIC with 60 end-to-end trials. We discuss crucial design
  decisions, limitations of the current system, and open challenges in this domain'
