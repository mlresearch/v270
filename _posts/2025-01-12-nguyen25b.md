title: Leveraging Mutual Information for Asymmetric Learning under Partial Observability
abstract: Even though partial observability is prevalent in robotics, most reinforcement
  learning studies avoid it due to the difficulty of learning a policy that can efficiently
  memorize past events and seek information. Fortunately, in many cases, learning
  can be done in an asymmetric setting where states are available during training
  but not during execution. Prior studies often leverage the state to indirectly influence
  the training of a history-based actor (actor-critic methods) or a history-based
  critic (value-based methods). Instead, we propose using state-observation and state-history
  mutual information to improve the agentâ€™s architecture and ability to seek information
  and memorize efficiently through intrinsic rewards and an auxiliary task. Our method
  outperforms strong baselines through extensive experiments and achieves successful
  sim-to-real transfers to a real robot.
