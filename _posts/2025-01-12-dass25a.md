title: 'Learning to Look: Seeking Information for Decision Making via Policy Factorization'
abstract: Many robot manipulation tasks require active or interactive exploration
  behavior in order to be performed successfully. Such tasks are ubiquitous in embodied
  domains, where agents must actively search for the information necessary for each
  stage of a task, e.g., moving the head of the robot to find information relevant
  to manipulation, or in multi-robot domains, where one scout robot may search for
  the information that another robot needs to make informed decisions. We identify
  these tasks with a new type of problem, factorized Contextual Markov Decision Processes,
  and propose DISaM, a dual-policy solution composed of an information-seeking policy
  that explores the environment to find the relevant contextual information and an
  information-receiving policy that exploits the context to achieve the manipulation
  goal. This factorization allows us to train both policies separately, using the
  information-receiving one to provide reward to train the information-seeking policy.
  At test time, the dual agent balances exploration and exploitation based on the
  uncertainty the manipulation policy has on what the next best action is. We demonstrate
  the capabilities of our dual policy solution in five manipulation tasks that require
  information-seeking behaviors, both in simulation and in the real-world, where DISaM
  significantly outperforms existing methods. More information at https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/learning2look/.
