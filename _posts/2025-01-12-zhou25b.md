title: Autonomous Improvement of Instruction Following Skills via Foundation Models
abstract: 'Intelligent robots capable of improving from autonomously collected experience
  have the potential to transform robot learning: instead of collecting costly teleoperated
  demonstration data, large-scale deployment of fleets of robots can quickly collect
  larger quantities of autonomous data useful for training better robot policies.
  However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating
  a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful
  robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations.
  To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing
  instruction following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without
  human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and
  evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes
  a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned
  image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly
  more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human
  annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments,
  the robot policy can be improved significantly with autonomously collected data.
  We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well
  as our autonomous dataset of 25K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments:
