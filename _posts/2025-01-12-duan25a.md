title: 'Manipulate-Anything: Automating Real-World Robots using Vision-Language Models'
abstract: 'Large-scale endeavors like RT-1 and widespread community efforts such as
  Open-X-Embodiment have contributed to growing the scale of robot demonstration data.
  However, there is still an opportunity to improve the quality, quantity, and diversity
  of robot demonstration data. Although vision-language models have been shown to
  automatically generate demonstration data, their utility has been limited to environments
  with privileged state information, they require hand-designed skills, and are limited
  to interactions with few object instances. We propose Manipulate-Anything, a scalable
  automated generation method for real-world robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work,
  our method can operate in real-world environments without any privileged state information,
  hand-designed skills, and can manipulate any static object. We evaluate our method
  using two setups. First, Manipulate-Anything successfully generates trajectories
  for all 5 real-world and 12 simulation tasks, significantly outperforming existing
  methods like VoxPoser. Second, Manipulate-Anythingâ€™s demonstrations can train more
  robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations, or from
  data generated by VoxPoser and Code-As-Policies. We believe Manipulate-Anything
  can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel
  tasks in a zero-shot setting. Anonymous project page: manipulate-anything.github.io.'
