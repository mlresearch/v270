title: 'Generative Factor Chaining: Coordinated Manipulation with Diffusion-based
  Factor Graph'
abstract: 'Learning to plan for multi-step, multi-manipulator tasks is notoriously
  difficult because of the large search space and the complex constraint satisfaction
  problems. We present Generative Factor Chaining (GFC), a composable generative model
  for planning. GFC represents a planning problem as a spatial-temporal factor graph,
  where nodes represent objects and robots in the scene, spatial factors capture the
  distributions of valid relationships among nodes, and temporal factors represent
  the distributions of skill transitions. Each factor is implemented as a modular
  diffusion model, which are composed during inference to generate feasible long-horizon
  plans through bi-directional message passing. We show that GFC can solve complex
  bimanual manipulation tasks and exhibits strong generalization to unseen planning
  tasks with novel combinations of objects and constraints. More details can be found
