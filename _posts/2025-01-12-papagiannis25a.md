title: 'MILES: Making Imitation Learning Easy with Self-Supervision'
abstract: 'Data collection in imitation learning often requires significant, laborious
  human supervision, such as numerous demonstrations, and/or frequent environment
  resets for methods that incorporate reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
  an alternative approach, MILES: a fully autonomous, self-supervised data collection
  paradigm, and we show that this enables efficient policy learning from just a single
  demonstration and a single environment reset. MILES autonomously learns a policy
  for returning to and then following the single demonstration, whilst being self-guided
  during data collection, eliminating the need for additional human interventions.
  We evaluated MILES across several realworld tasks, including tasks that require
  precise contact-rich manipulation such as locking a lock with a key. We found that,
  under the constraints of a single demonstration and no repeated environment resetting,
  MILES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives like imitation learning
  methods that leverage reinforcement learning. Videos of our experiments and code
  can be found on our webpage: www.robot-learning.uk/miles.'
