title: 'SPIRE: Synergistic Planning, Imitation, and Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon
  Manipulation'
abstract: Robot learning has proven to be a general and effective technique for programming
  manipulators. Imitation learning is able to teach robots solely from human demonstrations
  but is bottlenecked by the capabilities of the demonstrations. Reinforcement learning
  uses exploration to discover better behaviors; however, the space of possible improvements
  can be too large to start from scratch. And for both techniques, the learning difficulty
  increases proportional to the length of the manipulation task. Accounting for this,
  we propose SPIRE, a system that first uses Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) to decompose
  tasks into smaller learning subproblems and second combines imitation and reinforcement
  learning to maximize their strengths. We develop novel strategies to train learning
  agents when deployed in the context of a planning system. We evaluate SPIRE on a
  suite of long-horizon and contact-rich robot manipulation problems. We find that
  SPIRE outperforms prior approaches that integrate imitation learning, reinforcement
  learning, and planning by 35% to 50% in average task performance, is 6 times more
  data efficient in the number of human demonstrations needed to train proficient
  agents, and learns to complete tasks nearly twice as efficiently. View https://sites.google.com/view/spire-corl-2024
