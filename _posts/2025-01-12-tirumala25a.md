title: Learning Robot Soccer from Egocentric Vision with Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We apply multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train end-to-end
  robot soccer policies with fully onboard computation and sensing via egocentric
  RGB vision. This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics, including
  active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning in a dynamic,
  partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale, simulation-based
  data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric vision which can be
  successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost sensors. To achieve adequate
  visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body physics with learned, realistic
  rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We combine teacher-based
  multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated
  soccer strategies. We analyze active-perception behaviors including object tracking
  and ball seeking that emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play.
  The agents display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with
  access to privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes
  a first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer, mapping
  raw pixel observations to joint-level actions that can be deployed in the real world.
