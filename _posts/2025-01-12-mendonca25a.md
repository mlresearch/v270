title: Continuously Improving Mobile Manipulation with Autonomous Real-World RL
abstract: We present a fully autonomous real-world RL framework for mobile manipulation
  that can learn policies without extensive instrumentation or human supervision.
  This is enabled by 1) task-relevant autonomy, which guides exploration towards object
  interactions and prevents stagnation near goal states, 2) efficient policy learning
  by leveraging basic task knowledge in behavior priors, and 3) formulating generic
  rewards that combine human-interpretable semantic information with low-level, fine-grained
  observations. We demonstrate that our approach allows Spot robots to continually
  improve their performance on a set of four challenging mobile manipulation tasks,
  obtaining an average success rate of 80% across tasks, a 3-4 times improvement over
  existing approaches. Videos can be found at https://continual-mobile-manip.github.io/.
