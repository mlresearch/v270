title: 'RT-Sketch: Goal-Conditioned Imitation Learning from Hand-Drawn Sketches'
abstract: Natural language and images are commonly used as goal representations in
  goal-conditioned imitation learning. However, language can be ambiguous and images
  can be over-specified. In this work, we study hand-drawn sketches as a modality
  for goal specification. Sketches can be easy to provide on the fly like language,
  but like images they can also help a downstream policy to be spatially-aware. By
  virtue of being minimal, sketches can further help disambiguate task-relevant from
  irrelevant objects. We present RT-Sketch, a goal-conditioned policy for manipulation
  that takes a hand-drawn sketch of the desired scene as input, and outputs actions.
  We train RT-Sketch on a dataset of trajectories paired with synthetically generated
  goal sketches. We evaluate this approach on six manipulation skills involving tabletop
  object rearrangements on an articulated countertop. Experimentally we find that
  RT-Sketch performs comparably to image or language-conditioned agents in straightforward
  settings, while achieving greater robustness when language goals are ambiguous or
  visual distractors are present. Additionally, we show that RT-Sketch handles sketches
  with varied levels of specificity, ranging from minimal line drawings to detailed,
  colored drawings. For supplementary material and videos, please visit http://rt-sketch.github.io.
