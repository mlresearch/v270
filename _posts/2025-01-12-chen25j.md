title: Learning Differentiable Tensegrity Dynamics using Graph Neural Networks
abstract: Tensegrity robots are composed of rigid struts and flexible cables. They
  constitute an emerging class of hybrid rigid-soft robotic systems and are promising
  systems for a wide array of applications, ranging from locomotion to assembly. They
  are difficult to control and model accurately, however, due to their compliance
  and high number of degrees of freedom. To address this issue, prior work has introduced
  a differentiable physics engine designed for tensegrity robots based on first principles.
  In contrast, this work proposes the use of graph neural networks to model contact
  dynamics over a graph representation of tensegrity robots, which leverages their
  natural graph-like cable connec- tivity between end caps of rigid rods. This learned
  simulator can accurately model 3-bar and 6-bar tensegrity robot dynamics in simulation-to-simulation
  experiments where MuJoCo is used as the ground truth. It can also achieve higher
  accuracy than the previous differentiable engine for a real 3-bar tensegrity robot,
  for which the robot state is only partially observable. When compared against direct
  applications of recent mesh-based graph neural network simulators, the proposed
  approach is computationally more efficient, both for training and inference, while
  achieving higher accuracy. Code and data are available at https://github.com/nchen9191/tensegrity_gnn_simulator_public
