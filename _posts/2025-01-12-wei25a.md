title: 'Meta-Control: Automatic Model-based Control Synthesis for Heterogeneous Robot
  Skills'
abstract: The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often
  conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force compliance;
  some tasks require avoidance of certain regions while others require convergence
  to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements with a fixed state-action
  representation and control strategy is challenging, impeding the development of
  a universal robotic foundation model. In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the
  first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state
  representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight
  is that a meta-control system can be built to automate the thought process that
  human experts use to design control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily
  use a model-based, hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then
  compose various dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system.
  Meta-Control mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM’s extensive control knowledge
  with Socrates’ “art of midwifery” to automate the thought process. Meta-Control
  stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis, generalizability,
  robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable real-time execution.
