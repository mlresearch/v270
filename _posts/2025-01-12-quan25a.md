title: 'Control with Patterns: A D-learning Method'
abstract: Learning-based control policies are widely used in various tasks in the
  field of robotics and control. However, formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees for
  learning-based controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain.
  We propose a novel control approach, namely Control with Patterns (CWP), to address
  the stability issue over data sets corresponding to nonlinear dynamical systems.
  For data sets of this kind, we introduce a new definition, namely exponential attraction
  on data sets, to describe nonlinear dynamical systems under consideration. The problem
  of exponential attraction on data sets is converted to a pattern classification
  one based on the data sets and parameterized Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, D-learning
  is proposed as a method for performing CWP without knowledge of the system dynamics.
  Finally, the effectiveness of CWP based on D-learning is demonstrated through simulations
  and real flight experiments. In these experiments, the position of the multicopter
  is stabilized using only real-time images as feedback, which can be considered as
  an Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) problem.
