title: 'Not All Errors Are Made Equal: A Regret Metric for Detecting System-level
  Trajectory Prediction Failures'
abstract: 'Robot decision-making increasingly relies on data-driven human prediction
  models when operating around people. While these models are known to mispredict
  in out-of-distribution interactions, only a subset of prediction errors impact downstream
  robot performance. We propose characterizing such “system-level” prediction failures
  via the mathematical notion of regret: high-regret interactions are precisely those
  in which mispredictions degraded closed-loop robot performance. We further introduce
  a probabilistic generalization of regret that calibrates failure detection across
  disparate deployment contexts and renders regret compatible with reward-based and
  reward-free (e.g., generative) planners. In simulated autonomous driving interactions,
  we showcase that our system-level failure metric can automatically mine for closed-loop
  human-robot interactions that state-of-the-art generative human predictors and robot
  planners struggle with. We further find that the very presence of high-regret data
  during human predictor fine-tuning is highly predictive of robot re-deployment performance
  improvements. Furthermore, fine-tuning with the informative but significantly smaller
  high-regret data (23% of deployment data) is competitive with fine-tuning on the
  full deployment dataset, indicating a promising avenue for efficiently mitigating
  system-level human-robot interaction failures.'
