title: Detect Everything with Few Examples
abstract: Few-shot object detection aims at detecting novel categories given only
  a few example images. It is a basic skill for a robot to perform tasks in open environments.
  Recent methods focus on finetuning strategies, with complicated procedures that
  prohibit a wider application. In this paper, we introduce DE-ViT, a few-shot object
  detector without the need for finetuning. DE-ViTâ€™s novel architecture is based on
  a new region-propagation mechanism for localization. The propagated region masks
  are transformed into bounding boxes through a learnable spatial integral layer.
  Instead of training prototype classifiers, we propose to use prototypes to project
  ViT features into a subspace that is robust to overfitting on base classes. We evaluate
  DE-ViT on few-shot, and one-shot object detection benchmarks with Pascal VOC, COCO,
  and LVIS. DE-ViT establishes new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably,
  for COCO, DE-ViT surpasses the few-shot SoTA by 15 mAP on 10-shot and 7.2 mAP on
  30-shot and one-shot SoTA by 2.8 AP50. For LVIS, DE-ViT outperforms few-shot SoTA
  by 17 box APr. Further, we evaluate DE-ViT with a real robot by building a pick-and-place
  system for sorting novel objects based on example images. The videos of our robot
  demonstrations, the source code and the models of DE-ViT can be found at https://mlzxy.github.io/devit.
