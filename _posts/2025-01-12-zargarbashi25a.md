title: 'RobotKeyframing: Learning Locomotion with High-Level Objectives via Mixture
  of Dense and Sparse Rewards'
abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based control framework that uses keyframing
  to incorporate high-level objectives in natural locomotion for legged robots. These
  high-level objectives are specified as a variable number of partial or complete
  pose targets that are spaced arbitrarily in time. Our proposed framework utilizes
  a multi-critic reinforcement learning algorithm to effectively handle the mixture
  of dense and sparse rewards. Additionally, it employs a transformer-based encoder
  to accommodate a variable number of input targets, each associated with specific
  time-to-arrivals. Throughout simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate
  that our framework can effectively satisfy the target keyframe sequence at the required
  times. In the experiments, the multi-critic method significantly reduces the effort
  of hyperparameter tuning compared to the standard single-critic alternative. Moreover,
  the proposed transformer-based architecture enables robots to anticipate future
  goals, which results in quantitative improvements in their ability to reach their
  targets.
