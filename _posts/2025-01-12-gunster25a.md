title: Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
  learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe Reinforcement
  Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and robot kinematics
  and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them in complex real-world
  settings. Instead, model-based approaches that incorporate prior knowledge of the
  constraints and dynamics into the learning framework have proven capable of deploying
  the learning algorithm directly on the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated
  model of the robot dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific
  and hard to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive
  to compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety requirements.
  In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe exploration method, ATACOM,
  with learnable constraints, with a particular focus on ensuring long-term safety
  and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is competitive or superior to state-of-the-art
  methods in final performance while maintaining safer behavior during training.'
