title: 'D$^3$RoMa: Disparity Diffusion-based Depth Sensing for Material-Agnostic Robotic
  Manipulation'
abstract: Depth sensing is an important problem for 3D vision-based robotics. Yet,
  a real-world active stereo or ToF depth camera often produces noisy and incomplete
  depth which bottlenecks robot performances. In this work, we propose D3RoMa, a learning-based
  depth estimation framework on stereo image pairs that predicts clean and accurate
  depth in diverse indoor scenes, even in the most challenging scenarios with translucent
  or specular surfaces where classical depth sensing completely fails. Key to our
  method is that we unify depth estimation and restoration into an image-to-image
  translation problem by predicting the disparity map with a denoising diffusion probabilistic
  model. At inference time, we further incorporated a left-right consistency constraint
  as classifier guidance to the diffusion process. Our framework combines recently
  advanced learning-based approaches and geometric constraints from traditional stereo
  vision. For model training, we create a large scene-level synthetic dataset with
  diverse transparent and specular objects to compensate for existing tabletop datasets.
  The trained model can be directly applied to real-world in-the-wild scenes and achieve
  state-of-the-art performance in multiple public depth estimation benchmarks. Further
  experiments in both simulated and real environments show that accurate depth prediction
  significantly improves robotic manipulation in various scenarios.
