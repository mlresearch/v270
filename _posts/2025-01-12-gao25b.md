title: 'Multi-Transmotion: Pre-trained Model for Human Motion Prediction'
abstract: The ability of intelligent systems to predict human behaviors is essential,
  particularly in fields such as autonomous vehicle navigation and social robotics.
  However, the intricacies of human motion have precluded the development of a standardized
  dataset and model for human motion prediction, thereby hindering the establishment
  of pre-trained models. In this paper, we address these limitations by integrating
  multiple datasets, encompassing both trajectory and 3D pose keypoints, to further
  propose a pre-trained model for human motion prediction. We merge seven distinct
  datasets across varying modalities and standardize their formats. To facilitate
  multimodal pre-training, we introduce Multi-Transmotion, an innovative transformer-based
  model capable of cross-modality pre-training. Additionally, we devise a novel masking
  strategy to learn rich representations. Our methodology demonstrates competitive
  performance across various datasets on several downstream tasks, including trajectory
  prediction in the NBA and JTA datasets, as well as pose prediction in the AMASS
  and 3DPW datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.
