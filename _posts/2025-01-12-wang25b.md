title: 'D$^3$Fields: Dynamic 3D Descriptor Fields for Zero-Shot Generalizable Rearrangement'
abstract: 'Scene representation is a crucial design choice in robotic manipulation
  systems. An ideal representation is expected to be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to
  meet the demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack
  all three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fieldsâ€”**dynamic
  3D descriptor fields**. These fields are **implicit 3D representations** that take
  in 3D points and output semantic features and instance masks. They can also capture
  the dynamics of the underlying 3D environments. Specifically, we project arbitrary
  3D points in the workspace onto multi-view 2D visual observations and interpolate
  features derived from visual foundational models. The resulting fused descriptor
  fields allow for flexible goal specifications using 2D images with varied contexts,
  styles, and instances. To evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields,
  we apply our representation to rearrangement tasks in a zero-shot manner. Through
  extensive evaluation in real worlds and simulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields
  are effective for **zero-shot generalizable** rearrangement tasks. We also compare
  D$^3$Fields with state-of-the-art implicit 3D representations and show significant
  improvements in effectiveness and efficiency. Project page: https://robopil.github.io/d3fields/'
