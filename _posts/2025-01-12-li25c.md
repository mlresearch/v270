title: Evaluating Real-World Robot Manipulation Policies in Simulation
abstract: 'The field of robotics has made significant advances towards generalist
  robot manipulation policies. However, real-world evaluation of such policies is
  not scalable and faces reproducibility challenges, issues that are likely to worsen
  as policies broaden the spectrum of tasks they can perform. In this work, we demonstrate
  that simulation-based evaluation can be a scalable, reproducible, and reliable proxy
  for real-world evaluation. We identify control and visual disparities between real
  and simulated environments as key challenges for reliable simulated evaluation and
  propose approaches for mitigating these gaps without needing to painstakingly craft
  full-fidelity digital twins. We then employ these techniques to create SIMPLER,
  a collection of simulated environments for policy evaluation on common real robot
  manipulation setups. Through over 1500 paired sim-and-real evaluations of manipulation
  policies across two embodiments and eight task families, we demonstrate strong correlation
  between policy performance in SIMPLER environments and that in the real world. Beyond
  aggregated trends, we find that SIMPLER evaluations effectively reflect the real-world
  behaviors of individual policies, such as sensitivity to various distribution shifts.
  We are committed to open-sourcing all SIMPLER environments along with our workflow
  for creating new environments to facilitate research on general-purpose manipulation
  policies and simulated evaluation frameworks. Website: https://simpler-env.github.io/'
