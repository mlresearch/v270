title: 'Text2Interaction: Establishing Safe and Preferable Human-Robot Interaction'
abstract: Adjusting robot behavior to human preferences can require intensive human
  feedback, preventing quick adaptation to new users and changing circumstances. Moreover,
  current approaches typically treat user preferences as a reward, which requires
  a manual balance between task success and user satisfaction. To integrate new user
  preferences in a zero-shot manner, our proposed Text2Interaction framework invokes
  large language models to generate a task plan, motion preferences as Python code,
  and parameters of a safety controller. By maximizing the combined probability of
  task completion and user satisfaction instead of a weighted sum of rewards, we can
  reliably find plans that fulfill both requirements. We find that 83% of users working
  with Text2Interaction agree that it integrates their preferences into the plan of
  the robot, and 94% prefer Text2Interaction over the baseline. Our ablation study
  shows that Text2Interaction aligns better with unseen preferences than other baselines
  while maintaining a high success rate. Real-world demonstrations and code are made
  available at [sites.google.com/view/text2interaction](sites.google.com/view/text2interaction).
