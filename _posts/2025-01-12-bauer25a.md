title: An Open-Source Soft Robotic Platform for Autonomous Aerial Manipulation in
  the Wild
abstract: Aerial manipulation combines the versatility and speed of flying platforms
  with the functional capabilities of mobile manipulation, which presents significant
  challenges due to the need for precise localization and control. Traditionally,
  researchers have relied on off-board perception systems, which are limited to expensive
  and impractical specially equipped indoor environments. In this work, we introduce
  a novel platform for autonomous aerial manipulation that exclusively utilizes onboard
  perception systems. Our platform can perform aerial manipulation in various indoor
  and outdoor environments without depending on external perception systems. Our experimental
  results demonstrate the platform’s ability to autonomously grasp various objects
  in diverse settings. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and
  practicality of aerial manipulation applications by eliminating the need for costly
  tracking solutions. To accelerate future research, we open source our modern ROS
  2 software stack and custom hardware design, making our contributions accessible
  to the broader research community.
