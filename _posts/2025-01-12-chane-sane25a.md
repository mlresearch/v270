title: 'SoloParkour: Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Visual Locomotion from
  Privileged Experience'
abstract: Parkour poses a significant challenge for legged robots, requiring navigation
  through complex environments with agility and precision based on limited sensory
  inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel method for training end-to-end visual
  policies, from depth pixels to robot control commands, to achieve agile and safe
  quadruped locomotion. We formulate robot parkour as a constrained reinforcement
  learning (RL) problem designed to maximize the emergence of agile skills within
  the robot’s physical limits while ensuring safety. We first train a policy without
  vision using privileged information about the robot’s surroundings. We then generate
  experience from this privileged policy to warm-start a sample efficient off-policy
  RL algorithm from depth images. This allows the robot to adapt behaviors from this
  privileged experience to visual locomotion while circumventing the high computational
  costs of RL directly from pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
  on a real Solo-12 robot, showcasing its capability to perform a variety of parkour
  skills such as walking, climbing, leaping, and crawling.
