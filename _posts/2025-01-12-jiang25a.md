title: 'TRANSIC: Sim-to-Real Policy Transfer by Learning from Online Correction'
abstract: Learning in simulation and transferring the learned policy to the real world
  has the potential to enable generalist robots. The key challenge of this approach
  is to address simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gaps. Previous methods often require
  domain-specific knowledge *a priori*. We argue that a straightforward way to obtain
  such knowledge is by asking humans to observe and assist robot policy execution
  in the real world. The robots can then learn from humans to close various sim-to-real
  gaps. We propose TRANSIC, a data-driven approach to enable successful sim-to-real
  transfer based on a human-in-the-loop framework. TRANSIC allows humans to augment
  simulation policies to overcome various unmodeled sim-to-real gaps holistically
  through intervention and online correction. Residual policies can be learned from
  human corrections and integrated with simulation policies for autonomous execution.
  We show that our approach can achieve successful sim-to-real transfer in complex
  and contact-rich manipulation tasks such as furniture assembly. Through synergistic
  integration of policies learned in simulation and from humans, TRANSIC is effective
  as a holistic approach to addressing various, often coexisting sim-to-real gaps.
  It displays attractive properties such as scaling with human effort. Videos and
  code are available at https://transic-robot.github.io/.
