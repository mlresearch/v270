title: 'SonicSense: Object Perception from In-Hand Acoustic Vibration'
abstract: We introduce SonicSense, a holistic design of hardware and software to enable
  rich robot object perception through in-hand acoustic vibration sensing. While previous
  studies have shown promising results with acoustic sensing for object perception,
  current solutions are constrained to a handful of objects with simple geometries
  and homogeneous materials, single-finger sensing, and mixing training and testing
  on the same objects. SonicSense enables container inventory status differentiation,
  heterogeneous material prediction, 3D shape reconstruction, and object re-identification
  from a diverse set of 83 real-world objects. Our system employs a simple but effective
  heuristic exploration policy to interact with the objects as well as end-to-end
  learning-based algorithms to fuse vibration signals to infer object properties.
  Our framework underscores the significance of in-hand acoustic vibration sensing
  in advancing robot tactile perception.
