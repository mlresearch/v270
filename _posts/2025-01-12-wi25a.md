title: Neural Inverse Source Problem
abstract: 'Reconstructing unknown external source functions is an important perception
  capability for a large range of robotics domains including manipulation, aerial,
  and underwater robotics. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network
  (PINN) based approach for solving the inverse source problems in robotics, jointly
  identifying unknown source functions and the complete state of a system given partial
  and noisy observations. Our approach demonstrates several advantages over prior
  works (Finite Element Methods (FEM) and data-driven approaches): it offers flexibility
  in integrating diverse constraints and boundary conditions; eliminates the need
  for complex discretizations (e.g., meshing); easily accommodates gradients from
  real measurements; and does not limit performance based on the diversity and quality
  of training data. We validate our method across three simulation and real-world
  scenarios involving up to 4th order partial differential equations (PDEs), constraints
  such as Signorini and Dirichlet, and various regression losses including Chamfer
  distance and L2 norm.'
