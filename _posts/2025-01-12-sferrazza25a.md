title: 'Body Transformer: Leveraging Robot Embodiment for Policy Learning'
abstract: In recent years, the transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard
  for machine learning algorithms applied to natural language processing and computer
  vision. Despite notable evidence of successful deployment of this architecture in
  the context of robot learning, we claim that vanilla transformers do not fully exploit
  the structure of the robot learning problem. We propose Body Transformer (BoT),
  an architecture that exploits the robot embodiment by providing an inductive bias
  that guides the learning process. We represent the robot body as a graph of sensors
  and actuators, and rely on masked attention to pool information through the architecture.
  The resulting architecture outperforms the vanilla transformer, as well as the classical
  multilayer perceptron, with respect to task completion, scaling properties, and
  computational efficiency when representing either imitation or reinforcement learning
  policies.
