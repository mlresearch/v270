title: 'FREA: Feasibility-Guided Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios with Reasonable
  Adversariality'
abstract: Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are essential yet difficult
  to collect at scale, offers an effective method to evaluate the robustness of autonomous
  vehicles (AVs). Existing methods focus on optimizing adversariality while preserving
  the naturalness of scenarios, aiming to achieve a balance through data-driven approaches.
  However, without an appropriate upper bound for adversariality, the scenarios might
  exhibit excessive adversariality, potentially leading to unavoidable collisions.
  In this paper, we introduce FREA, a novel safety-critical scenarios generation method
  that incorporates the Largest Feasible Region (LFR) of AV as guidance to ensure
  the reasonableness of the adversarial scenarios. Concretely, FREA initially pre-calculates
  the LFR of AV from offline datasets. Subsequently, it learns a reasonable adversarial
  policy that controls critical background vehicles (CBVs) in the scene to generate
  adversarial yet AV-feasible scenarios by maximizing a novel feasibility-dependent
  objective function. Extensive experiments illustrate that FREA can effectively generate
  safety-critical scenarios, yielding considerable near-miss events while ensuring
  AVâ€™s feasibility. Generalization analysis also confirms the robustness of FREA in
  AV testing across various surrogate AV methods and traffic environments.
