title: Structured Bayesian Meta-Learning for Data-Efficient Visual-Tactile Model Estimation
abstract: Estimating visual-tactile models of deformable objects is challenging because
  vision suffers from occlusion, while touch data is sparse and noisy. We propose
  a novel data-efficient method for dense heterogeneous model estimation by leveraging
  experience from diverse training objects. The method is based on Bayesian Meta-Learning
  (BML), which can mitigate overfitting high-capacity visual-tactile models by meta-learning
  an informed prior and naturally achieves few-shot online estimation via posterior
  estimation. However, BML requires a shared parametric model across tasks but visual-tactile
  models for diverse objects have different parameter spaces. To address this issue,
  we introduce Structured Bayesian Meta-Learning (SBML) that incorporates heterogeneous
  physics models, enabling learning from training objects with varying appearances
  and geometries. SBML performs zero-shot vision-only prediction of deformable model
  parameters and few-shot adaptation after a handful of touches. Experiments show
  that in two classes of heterogeneous objects, namely plants and shoes, SBML outperforms
  existing approaches in force and torque prediction accuracy in zero- and few-shot
  settings.
