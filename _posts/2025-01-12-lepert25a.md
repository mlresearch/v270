title: 'SHADOW: Leveraging Segmentation Masks for Cross-Embodiment Policy Transfer'
abstract: Data collection in robotics is spread across diverse hardware, and this
  variation will increase as new hardware is developed. Effective use of this growing
  body of data requires methods capable of learning from diverse robot embodiments.
  We consider the setting of training a policy using expert trajectories from a single
  robot arm (the source), and evaluating on a different robot arm for which no data
  was collected (the target). We present a data editing scheme termed Shadow, in which
  the robot during training and evaluation is replaced with a composite segmentation
  mask of the source and target robots. In this way, the input data distribution at
  train and test time match closely, enabling robust policy transfer to the new unseen
  robot while being far more data efficient than approaches that require co-training
  on large amounts of data from diverse embodiments. We demonstrate that an approach
  as simple as Shadow is effective both in simulation on varying tasks and robots,
  and on real robot hardware, where Shadow demonstrates over 2x improvement in success
  rate compared to the strongest baseline.
