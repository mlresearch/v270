title: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid Action Space for Free Gait Motion
  Planning of Hexapod Robots
abstract: Legged robots are able to overcome challenging terrains through diverse
  gaits formed by contact sequences. However, environments characterized by discrete
  footholds present significant challenges. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
  free gait motion planning for hexapod robots walking in randomly generated plum
  blossom pile environments. Specifically, we first address the complexity of multi-leg
  coordination in discrete environments by treating each leg of the hexapod robot
  as an individual agent. Then, we propose the Hybrid action space Multi-Agent Soft
  Actor Critic (Hybrid-MASAC) algorithm capable of handling both discrete and continuous
  actions. Finally, we present an integrated free gait motion planning method based
  on Hybrid-MASAC, streamlining gait, Center of Mass (COM), and foothold sequences
  planning into a single model. Comparative and ablation experiments in both of the
  simulated and real plum blossom pile environments demonstrate the feasibility and
  efficiency of our method.
