title: Multi-Strategy Deployment-Time Learning and Adaptation for Navigation under
  Uncertainty
abstract: We present an approach for performant point-goal navigation in unfamiliar
  partially-mapped environments. When deployed, our robot runs multiple strategies
  for deployment-time learning and visual domain adaptation in parallel and quickly
  selects the best-performing among them. Choosing between policies as they are learned
  or adapted between navigation trials requires continually updating estimates of
  their performance as they evolve. Leveraging recent work in model-based learning-informed
  planning under uncertainty, we determine lower bounds on the would-be performance
  of newly-updated policies on old trials without needing to re-deploy them. This
  information constrains and accelerates bandit-like policy selection, affording quick
  selection of the best-performing strategy shortly after it would start to yield
  good performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in simulated maze-like
  environments, showing improved navigation cost and cumulative regret versus existing
  baselines.
