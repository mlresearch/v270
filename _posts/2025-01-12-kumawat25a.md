title: 'RoboKoop: Efficient Control Conditioned Representations from Visual Input
  in Robotics using Koopman Operator'
abstract: Developing agents that can perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional
  observations is a core ability of autonomous agents that requires underlying robust
  task control policies and adapting the underlying visual representations to the
  task. Most existing policies need a lot of training samples and treat this problem
  from the lens of two-stage learning with a controller learned on top of pre-trained
  vision models. We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory and learn
  visual representations from robotic agents conditioned on specific downstream tasks
  in the context of learning stabilizing control for the agent. We introduce a Contrastive
  Spectral Koopman Embedding network that allows us to learn efficient linearized
  visual representations from the agentâ€™s visual data in a high dimensional latent
  space and utilizes reinforcement learning to perform off-policy control on top of
  the extracted representations with a linear controller. Our method enhances stability
  and control in gradient dynamics over time, significantly outperforming existing
  approaches by improving efficiency and accuracy in learning task policies over extended
  horizons.
