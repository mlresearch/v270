title: 'WoCoCo: Learning Whole-Body Humanoid Control with Sequential Contacts'
abstract: 'Humanoid activities involving sequential contacts are crucial for complex
  robotic interactions and operations in the real world and are traditionally solved
  by model-based motion planning, which is time-consuming and often relies on simplified
  dynamics models. Although model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful
  tool for versatile and robust whole-body humanoid control, it still requires tedious
  task-specific tuning and state machine design and suffers from long-horizon exploration
  issues in tasks involving contact sequences. In this work, we propose WoCoCo (Whole-Body
  Control with Sequential Contacts), a unified framework to learn whole-body humanoid
  control with sequential contacts by naturally decomposing the tasks into separate
  contact stages. Such decomposition facilitates simple and general policy learning
  pipelines through task-agnostic reward and sim-to-real designs, requiring only one
  or two task-related terms to be specified for each task. We demonstrated that end-to-end
  RL-based controllers trained with WoCoCo enable four challenging whole-body humanoid
  tasks involving diverse contact sequences in the real world without any motion priors:
  1) versatile parkour jumping, 2) box loco-manipulation, 3) dynamic clap-and-tap
  dancing, and 4) cliffside climbing. We further show that WoCoCo is a general framework
  beyond humanoid by applying it in 22-DoF dinosaur robot loco-manipulation tasks.
