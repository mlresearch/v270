title: 'TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception
  Estimation'
abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and
  challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires
  a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation
  in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose
  TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path
  planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception.
  TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path
  and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present a terrain estimator that
  enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while
  effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we construct a proprioception
  advisor from the learning-based locomotion controller to provide motion evaluations
  for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we offer online corrections
  for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves
  open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond
  the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual
  conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and
  real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world
  navigation compared to existing methods.
