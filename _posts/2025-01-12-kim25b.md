title: Pre-emptive Action Revision by Environmental Feedback for Embodied Instruction
  Following Agents
abstract: When we, humans, perform a task, we consider changes in environments such
  as objectsâ€™ arrangement due to interactions with objects and other reasons; e.g.,
  when we find a mug to clean, if it is already clean, we skip cleaning it. But even
  the state-of-the-art embodied agents often ignore changed environments when performing
  a task, leading to failure to complete the task, executing unnecessary actions,
  or fixing the mistake after it was made. Here, we propose Pre-emptive Action Revision
  by Environmental feeDback (PRED) that allows an embodied agent to revise their action
  in response to the perceived environmental status before it makes mistakes. We empirically
  validate PRED and observe that it outperforms the prior art on two challenging benchmarks
  in the virtual environment, TEACh and ALFRED, by noticeable margins in most metrics,
  including unseen success rates, with shorter execution time, implying an efficiently
  behaved agent. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
  with real robot experiments.
