title: 'SELFI: Autonomous Self-Improvement with RL for Vision-Based Navigation around
  People'
abstract: Autonomous self-improving robots that interact and improve with experience
  are key to the real-world deployment of robotic systems. In this paper, we propose
  an online learning method, SELFI, that leverages online robot experience to rapidly
  fine-tune pre-trained control policies efficiently. SELFI applies online model-free
  reinforcement learning on top of offline model-based learning to bring out the best
  parts of both learning paradigms. Specifically, SELFI stabilizes the online learning
  process by incorporating the same model-based learning objective from offline pre-training
  into the Q-values learned with online model-free reinforcement learning. We evaluate
  SELFI in multiple real-world environments and report improvements in terms of collision
  avoidance, as well as more socially compliant behavior, measured by a human user
  study. SELFI enables us to quickly learn useful robotic behaviors with less human
  interventions such as pre-emptive behavior for the pedestrians, collision avoidance
  for small and transparent objects, and avoiding travel on uneven floor surfaces.
  We provide supplementary videos to demonstrate the performance of our fine-tuned
  policy.
