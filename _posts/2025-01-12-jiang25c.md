title: 'RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via Interactive Exploration for Robotic
  Manipulation'
abstract: 'We introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots
  autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph
  (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts
  for both low-level information (geometry and semantics) and high-level information
  (action-conditioned relationships between different entities) in the scene. To this
  end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the
  Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our systemâ€™s
  capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating
  new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the
  ACSG. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency
  of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks
  involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects, and deformable objects. Project
