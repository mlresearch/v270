title: 'ScissorBot: Learning Generalizable Scissor Skill for Paper Cutting via Simulation,
  Imitation, and Sim2Real'
abstract: This paper tackles the challenging robotic task of generalizable paper cutting
  using scissors. In this task, scissors attached to a robot arm are driven to accurately
  cut curves drawn on the paper, which is hung with the top edge fixed. Due to the
  frequent paper-scissor contact and consequent fracture, the paper features continual
  deformation and changing topology, which is diffult for accurate modeling.To deal
  with such versatile scenarios, we propose ScissorBot, the first learning-based system
  for robotic paper cutting with scissors via simulation, imitation learning and sim2real.
  Given the lack of sufficient data for this task, we build PaperCutting-Sim, a paper
  simulator supporting interactive fracture coupling with scissors, enabling demonstration
  generation with a heuristic-based oracle policy. To ensure effective execution,
  we customize an action primitive sequence for imitation learning to constrain its
  action space, thus alleviating potential compounding errors. Finally, by integrating
  sim-to-real techniques to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, our policy
  can be effectively deployed on the real robot. Experimental results demonstrate
  that our method surpasses all baselines in both simulation and real-world benchmarks
  and achives performance comparable to human operation with a single hand under the
  same conditions.
