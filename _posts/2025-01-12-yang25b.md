title: 'Generalized Animal Imitator: Agile Locomotion with Versatile Motion Prior'
abstract: 'The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running,
  turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design.
  Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential
  inquiries: How can a robot be trained to learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously?
  How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate
  these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable
  Motion prior (VIM) – a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate
  a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our
  framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating
  animal motions and manually designed motions. Our Functionality reward guides the
  robot’s ability to adopt varied skills, and our Stylization reward ensures that
  robot motions align with reference motions. Our evaluations of the VIM framework
  span both simulation environments and real-world deployment. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first work that allows a robot to concurrently learn diverse
  agile locomotion skills using a single learning-based controller in the real world.'
