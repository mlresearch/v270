title: Bi-Level Motion Imitation for Humanoid Robots
abstract: Imitation learning from human motion capture (MoCap) data provides a promising
  way to train humanoid robots. However, due to differences in morphology, such as
  varying degrees of joint freedom and force limits, exact replication of human behaviors
  may not be feasible for humanoid robots. Consequently, incorporating physically
  infeasible MoCap data in training datasets can adversely affect the performance
  of the robot policy. To address this issue, we propose a bi-level optimization-based
  imitation learning framework that alternates between optimizing both the robot policy
  and the target MoCap data. Specifically, we first develop a generative latent dynamics
  model using a novel self-consistent auto-encoder, which learns sparse and structured
  motion representations while capturing desired motion patterns in the dataset. The
  dynamics model is then utilized to generate reference motions while the latent representation
  regularizes the bi-level motion imitation process. Simulations conducted with a
  realistic model of a humanoid robot demonstrate that our method enhances the robot
  policy by modifying reference motions to be physically consistent.
