title: 'PianoMime: Learning a Generalist, Dexterous Piano Player from Internet Demonstrations'
abstract: 'In this work, we introduce PianoMime, a framework for training a piano-playing
  agent using internet demonstrations. The internet is a promising source of large-scale
  demonstrations for training our robot agents. In particular, for the case of piano-playing,
  Youtube is full of videos of professional pianists playing a wide myriad of songs.
  In our work, we leverage these demonstrations to learn a generalist piano-playing
  agent capable of playing any arbitrary song. Our framework is divided into three
  parts: a data preparation phase to extract the informative features from the Youtube
  videos, a policy learning phase to train song-specific expert policies from the
  demonstrations and a policy distillation phase to distil the policies into a single
  generalist agent. We explore different policy designs to represent the agent and
  evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on the generalization capability
  of the agent to novel songs not available in the dataset. We show that we are able
  to learn a policy with up to 57% F1 score on unseen songs.'
