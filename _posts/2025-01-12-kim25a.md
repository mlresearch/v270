title: 'Surgical Robot Transformer (SRT): Imitation Learning for Surgical Tasks'
abstract: We explore whether surgical manipulation tasks can be learned on the da
  Vinci robot via imitation learning. However, the da Vinci system presents unique
  challenges which hinder straight-forward implementation of imitation learning. Notably,
  its forward kinematics is inconsistent due to imprecise joint measurements, and
  naively training a policy using such approximate kinematics data often leads to
  task failure. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a relative action formulation
  which enables successful policy training and deployment using its approximate kinematics
  data. A promising outcome of this approach is that the large repository of clinical
  data, which contains approximate kinematics, may be directly utilized for robot
  learning without further corrections. We demonstrate our findings through successful
  execution of three fundamental surgical tasks, including tissue manipulation, needle
  handling, and knot-tying.
