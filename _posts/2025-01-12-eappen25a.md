title: Scaling Safe Multi-Agent Control for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
abstract: Existing methods for safe multi-agent control using logic specifications
  like Signal Temporal Logic (STL) often face scalability issues. This is because
  they rely either on single-agent perspectives or on Mixed Integer Linear Programming
  (MILP)-based planners, which are complex to optimize. These methods have proven
  to be computationally expensive and inefficient when dealing with a large number
  of agents. To address these limitations, we present a new scalable approach to multi-agent
  control in this setting. Our method treats the relationships between agents using
  a graph structure rather than in terms of a single-agent perspective. Moreover,
  it combines a multi-agent collision avoidance controller with a Graph Neural Network
  (GNN) based planner, models the system in a decentralized fashion, and trains on
  STL-based objectives to generate safe and efficient plans for multiple agents, thereby
  optimizing the satisfaction of complex temporal specifications while also facilitating
  multi-agent collision avoidance. Our experiments show that our approach significantly
  outperforms existing methods that use a state-of-the-art MILP-based planner in terms
  of scalability and performance.
