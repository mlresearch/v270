title: 'PoliFormer: Scaling On-Policy RL with Transformers Results in Masterful Navigators'
abstract: We present PoliFormer (Policy Transformer), an RGB-only indoor navigation
  agent trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning at scale that generalizes to
  the real-world without adaptation despite being trained purely in simulation. PoliFormer
  uses a foundational vision transformer encoder with a causal transformer decoder
  enabling long-term memory and reasoning. It is trained for hundreds of millions
  of interactions across diverse environments, leveraging parallelized, multi-machine
  rollouts for efficient training with high throughput. PoliFormer is a masterful
  navigator, producing state-of-the-art results across two distinct embodiments, the
  LoCoBot and Stretch RE-1 robots, and four navigation benchmarks. It breaks through
  the plateaus of previous work, achieving an unprecedented 85.5% success rate in
  object goal navigation on the CHORES-S benchmark, a 28.5% absolute improvement.
  PoliFormer can also be trivially extended to a variety of downstream applications
  such as object tracking, multi-object navigation, and open-vocabulary navigation
  with no finetuning.
