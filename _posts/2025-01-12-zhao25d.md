title: 'RP1M: A Large-Scale Motion Dataset for Piano Playing with Bi-Manual Dexterous
  Robot Hands'
abstract: Endowing robot hands with human-level dexterity is a long-lasting research
  objective. Bi-manual robot piano playing constitutes a task that combines challenges
  from dynamic tasks, such as generating fast while precise motions, with slower but
  contact-rich manipulation problems. Although reinforcement learning based approaches
  have shown promising results in single-task performance, these methods struggle
  in a multi-song setting. Our work aims to close this gap and, thereby, enable imitation
  learning approaches for robot piano playing at scale. To this end, we introduce
  the Robot Piano 1 Million (RP1M) dataset, containing bi-manual robot piano playing
  motion data of more than one million trajectories. We formulate finger placements
  as an optimal transport problem, thus, enabling automatic annotation of vast amounts
  of unlabeled songs. Benchmarking existing imitation learning approaches shows that
  such approaches reach state-of-the-art robot piano playing performance by leveraging
  RP1M.
