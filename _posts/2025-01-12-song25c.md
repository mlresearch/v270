title: Genetic Algorithm for Curriculum Design in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: As the deployment of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios grows, so
  does the interest in their application to competitive environments with other robots.
  Self-play in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to develop competitive strategies.
  However, the complexity arising from multi-agent interactions and the tendency for
  RL agents to disrupt competitors’ training introduce instability and a risk of overfitting.
  While traditional methods depend on costly Nash equilibrium approximations or random
  exploration for training scenario optimization, this can be inefficient in large
  search spaces often prevalent in multi-agent problems. However, related works in
  single-agent setups show that genetic algorithms perform better in large scenario
  spaces. Therefore, we propose using genetic algorithms to adaptively adjust environment
  parameters and opponent policies in a multi-agent context to find and synthesize
  coherent scenarios efficiently. We also introduce GenOpt Agent—a genetically optimized,
  open-loop agent executing scheduled actions. The open-loop aspect of GenOpt prevents
  RL agents from winning through adversarial perturbations, thereby fostering generalizable
  strategies. Also, GenOpt is genetically optimized without expert supervision, negating
  the need for expensive expert supervision to have meaningful opponents at the start
  of training. Our empirical studies indicate that this method surpasses several established
  baselines in two-player competitive settings with continuous action spaces, validating
  its effectiveness and stability in training.
