title: 'UMI-on-Legs: Making Manipulation Policies Mobile with Manipulation-Centric
  Whole-body Controllers'
abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Legs, a new framework that combines real-world and simulation
  data for quadruped manipulation systems. We scale task-centric data collection in
  the real world using a handheld gripper (UMI), providing a cheap way to demonstrate
  task-relevant manipulation skills without a robot. Simultaneously, we scale robot-centric
  data in simulation by training a whole-body controller. The interface between these
  two policies are end-effector trajectories in the task-frame, which are inferred
  by the manipulation policy and passed to the whole-body controller for tracking.
  We evaluate UMI-on-Legs on prehensile, non-prehensile, and dynamic manipulation
  tasks, and report over 70% success rate for all tasks. Lastly, we also demonstrate
  the zero-shot cross-embodiment deployment of a pre-trained manipulation policy checkpoint
  from a prior work, originally intended for a fixed-base robot arm, on our quadruped
  system. We believe this framework provides a scalable path towards learning expressive
  manipulation skills on dynamic robot embodiments.
