title: 'Jacta: A Versatile Planner for Learning Dexterous and Whole-body Manipulation'
abstract: 'Robotic manipulation is challenging due to discontinuous dynamics, as well
  as high-dimensional state and action spaces. Data-driven approaches that succeed
  in manipulation tasks require large amounts of data and expert demonstrations, typically
  from humans. Existing planners are restricted to specific systems and often depend
  on specialized algorithms for using demonstrations. Therefore, we introduce a flexible
  motion planner tailored to dexterous and whole-body manipulation tasks. Our planner
  creates readily usable demonstrations for reinforcement learning algorithms, eliminating
  the need for additional training pipeline complexities. With this approach, we can
  efficiently learn policies for complex manipulation tasks, where traditional reinforcement
  learning alone only makes little progress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learned
  policies are transferable to real robotic systems for solving complex dexterous
  manipulation tasks. Project website: https://jacta-manipulation.github.io/'
