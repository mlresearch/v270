title: Learning to Open and Traverse Doors with a Legged Manipulator
abstract: Using doors is a longstanding challenge in robotics and is of significant
  practical interest in giving robots greater access to human-centric spaces. The
  task is challenging due to the need for online adaptation to varying door properties
  and precise control in manipulating the door panel and navigating through the confined
  doorway. To address this, we propose a learning-based controller for a legged manipulator
  to open and traverse through doors. The controller is trained using a teacher-student
  approach in simulation to learn robust task behaviors as well as estimate crucial
  door properties during the interaction. Unlike previous works, our approach is a
  single control policy that can handle both push and pull doors through learned behaviour
  which infers the opening direction during deployment without prior knowledge. The
  policy was deployed on the ANYmal legged robot with an arm and achieved a success
  rate of 95.0% in repeated trials conducted in an experimental setting. Additional
  experiments validate the policyâ€™s effectiveness and robustness to various doors
  and disturbances. A video overview of the method and experiments is provided in
  the supplementary material.
