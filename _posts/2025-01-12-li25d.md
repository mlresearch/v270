title: 'FlowBotHD: History-Aware Diffuser Handling Ambiguities in Articulated Objects
  Manipulation'
abstract: We introduce a novel approach to manipulate articulated objects with ambiguities,
  such as opening a door, in which multi-modality and occlusions create ambiguities
  about the opening side and direction. Multi-modality occurs when the method to open
  a fully closed door (push, pull, slide) is uncertain, or the side from which it
  should be opened is uncertain. Occlusions further obscure the doorâ€™s shape from
  certain angles, creating further ambiguities during the occlusion. To tackle these
  challenges, we propose a history-aware diffusion network that models the multi-modal
  distribution of the articulated object and uses history to disambiguate actions
  and make stable predictions under occlusions. Experiments and analysis demonstrate
  the state-of-art performance of our method and specifically improvements in ambiguity-caused
  failure modes. Our project website is available at https://flowbothd.github.io/.
