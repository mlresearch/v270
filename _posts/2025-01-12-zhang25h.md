title: Leveraging Locality to Boost Sample Efficiency in Robotic Manipulation
abstract: Given the high cost of collecting robotic data in the real world, sample
  efficiency is a consistently compelling pursuit in robotics. In this paper, we introduce
  SGRv2, an imitation learning framework that enhances sample efficiency through improved
  visual and action representations. Central to the design of SGRv2 is the incorporation
  of a critical inductive bias—$\textit{action locality}$, which posits that robot’s
  actions are predominantly influenced by the target object and its interactions with
  the local environment. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings
  demonstrate that action locality is essential for boosting sample efficiency. SGRv2
  excels in RLBench tasks with keyframe control using merely 5 demonstrations and
  surpasses the RVT baseline in 23 of 26 tasks. Furthermore, when evaluated on ManiSkill2
  and MimicGen using dense control, SGRv2’s success rate is 2.54 times that of SGR.
  In real-world environments, with only eight demonstrations, SGRv2 can perform a
  variety of tasks at a markedly higher success rate compared to baseline models.
