title: 'DextrAH-G: Pixels-to-Action Dexterous Arm-Hand Grasping with Geometric Fabrics'
abstract: A pivotal challenge in robotics is achieving fast, safe, and robust dexterous
  grasping across a diverse range of objects, an important goal within industrial
  applications. However, existing methods often have very limited speed, dexterity,
  and generality, along with limited or no hardware safety guarantees. In this work,
  we introduce DextrAH-G, a depth-based dexterous grasping policy trained entirely
  in simulation that combines reinforcement learning, geometric fabrics, and teacher-student
  distillation. We address key challenges in joint arm-hand policy learning, such
  as high-dimensional observation and action spaces, the sim2real gap, collision avoidance,
  and hardware constraints. DextrAH-G enables a 23 motor arm-hand robot to safely
  and continuously grasp and transport a large variety of objects at high speed using
  multi-modal inputs including depth images, allowing generalization across object
  geometry. Videos at https://sites.google.com/view/dextrah-g.
