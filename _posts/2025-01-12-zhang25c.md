title: 'EXTRACT: Efficient Policy Learning by Extracting Transferable Robot Skills
  from Offline Data'
abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods focus on learning optimal policies
  over low-level action spaces. While these methods can perform well in their training
  environments, they lack the flexibility to transfer to new tasks. Instead, RL agents
  that can act over useful, temporally extended skills rather than low-level actions
  can learn new tasks more easily. Prior work in skill-based RL either requires expert
  supervision to define useful skills, which is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space
  from offline data with heuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making
  them difficult to transfer during downstream RL. Our approach, EXTRACT, instead
  utilizes pre-trained vision language models to extract a discrete set of semantically
  meaningful skills from offline data, each of which is parameterized by continuous
  arguments, without human supervision. This skill parameterization allows robots
  to learn new tasks by only needing to learn when to select a specific skill and
  how to modify its arguments for the specific task. We demonstrate through experiments
  in sparse-reward, image-based, robot manipulation environments that EXTRACT can
  more quickly learn new tasks than prior works, with major gains in sample efficiency
  and performance over prior skill-based RL.
