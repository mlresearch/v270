title: Visual Whole-Body Control for Legged Loco-Manipulation
abstract: We study the problem of mobile manipulation using legged robots equipped
  with an arm, namely legged loco-manipulation. The robot legs, while usually utilized
  for mobility, offer an opportunity to amplify the manipulation capabilities by conducting
  whole-body control. That is, the robot can control the legs and the arm at the same
  time to extend its workspace. We propose a framework that can conduct the whole-body
  control autonomously with visual observations. Our approach, namely Visual Whole-Body
  Control (VBC), is composed of a low-level policy using all degrees of freedom to
  track the body velocities along with the end-effector position, and a high-level
  policy proposing the velocities and end-effector position based on visual inputs.
  We train both levels of policies in simulation and perform Sim2Real transfer for
  real robot deployment. We perform extensive experiments and show significant improvements
  over baselines in picking up diverse objects in different configurations (heights,
  locations, orientations) and environments.
