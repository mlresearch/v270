title: 'ThinkGrasp: A Vision-Language System for Strategic Part Grasping in Clutter'
abstract: Robotic grasping in cluttered environments remains a significant challenge
  due to occlusions and complex object arrangements. We have developed ThinkGrasp,
  a plug-and-play vision-language grasping system that makes use of GPT-4oâ€™s advanced
  contextual reasoning for grasping strategies. ThinkGrasp can effectively identify
  and generate grasp poses for target objects, even when they are heavily obstructed
  or nearly invisible, by using goal-oriented language to guide the removal of obstructing
  objects. This approach progressively uncovers the target object and ultimately grasps
  it with a few steps and a high success rate. In both simulated and real experiments,
  ThinkGrasp achieved a high success rate and significantly outperformed state-of-the-art
  methods in heavily cluttered environments or with diverse unseen objects, demonstrating
  strong generalization capabilities.
