title: Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap from the Information Bottleneck Perspective
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in
  robotic control. However, most works in RL operate in simulated environments where
  privileged knowledge (e.g., dynamics, surroundings, terrains) is readily available.
  Conversely, in real-world scenarios, robot agents usually rely solely on local states
  (e.g., proprioceptive feedback of robot joints) to select actions, leading to a
  significant sim-to-real gap. Existing methods address this gap by either gradually
  reducing the reliance on privileged knowledge or performing a two-stage policy imitation.
  However, we argue that these methods are limited in their ability to fully leverage
  the available privileged knowledge, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
  paper, we formulate the sim-to-real gap as an information bottleneck problem and
  therefore propose a novel privileged knowledge distillation method called the Historical
  Information Bottleneck (HIB). In particular, HIB learns a privileged knowledge representation
  from historical trajectories by capturing the underlying changeable dynamic information.
  Theoretical analysis shows that the learned privileged knowledge representation
  helps reduce the value discrepancy between the oracle and learned policies. Empirical
  experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that HIB yields improved
  generalizability compared to previous methods.
