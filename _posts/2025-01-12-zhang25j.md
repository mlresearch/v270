title: 'DexGraspNet 2.0: Learning Generative Dexterous Grasping in Large-scale Synthetic
  Cluttered Scenes'
abstract: Grasping in cluttered scenes remains highly challenging for dexterous hands
  due to the scarcity of data. To address this problem, we present a large-scale synthetic
  dataset, encompassing 1319 objects, 8270 scenes, and 426 million grasps. Beyond
  benchmarking, we also explore data-efficient learning strategies from grasping data.
  We reveal that the combination of a conditional generative model that focuses on
  local geometry and a grasp dataset that emphasizes complex scene variations is key
  to achieving effective generalization. Our proposed generative method outperforms
  all baselines in simulation experiments. Furthermore, it demonstrates zero-shot
  sim-to-real transfer through test-time depth restoration, attaining 91% real-world
  success rate, showcasing the robust potential of utilizing fully synthetic training
  data.
