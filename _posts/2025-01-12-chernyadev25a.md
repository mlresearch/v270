title: 'BiGym: A Demo-Driven Mobile Bi-Manual Manipulation Benchmark'
abstract: We introduce BiGym, a new benchmark and learning environment for mobile
  bi-manual demo-driven robotic manipulation. BiGym features 40 diverse tasks set
  in home environments, ranging from simple target reaching to complex kitchen cleaning.
  To capture the real-world performance accurately, we provide human-collected demonstrations
  for each task, reflecting the diverse modalities found in real-world robot trajectories.
  BiGym supports a variety of observations, including proprioceptive data and visual
  inputs such as RGB, and depth from 3 camera views. To validate the usability of
  BiGym, we thoroughly benchmark the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms
  and demo-driven reinforcement learning algorithms within the environment and discuss
  the future opportunities.
