title: Lessons from Learning to Spin “Pens”
abstract: 'In-hand manipulation of pen-like objects is a most basic and important
  skill in our daily lives, as many tools such as hammers and screwdrivers are similarly
  shaped. However, current learning-based methods struggle with this task due to a
  lack of high-quality demonstrations and the significant gap between simulation and
  the real world. In this work, we push the boundaries of learning-based in-hand manipulation
  systems by demonstrating the capability to spin pen-like objects. We use reinforcement
  learning to train a policy and generate a high-fidelity trajectory dataset in simulation.
  This serves two purposes: 1) pre-training a sensorimotor policy in simulation; 2)
  conducting open-loop trajectory replay in the real world. We then fine-tune the
  sensorimotor policy using these real-world trajectories to adapt to the real world.
  With less than 50 trajectories, our policy learns to rotate more than ten pen-like
  objects with different physical properties for multiple revolutions. We present
  a comprehensive analysis of our design choices and share the lessons learned during
  development. Videos are shown on https://corl-2024-dexpen.github.io/.'
