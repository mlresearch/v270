title: 'Q-SLAM: Quadric Representations for Monocular SLAM'
abstract: In this paper, we reimagine volumetric representations through the lens
  of quadrics. We posit that rigid scene components can be effectively decomposed
  into quadric surfaces. Leveraging this assumption, we reshape the volumetric representations
  with million of cubes by several quadric planes, which results in more accurate
  and efficient modeling of 3D scenes in SLAM contexts. First, we use the quadric
  assumption to rectify noisy depth estimations from RGB inputs. This step significantly
  improves depth estimation accuracy, and allows us to efficiently sample ray points
  around quadric planes instead of the entire volume space in previous NeRF-SLAM systems.
  Second, we introduce a novel quadric-decomposed transformer to aggregate information
  across quadrics. The quadric semantics are not only explicitly used for depth correction
  and scene decomposition, but also serve as an implicit supervision signal for the
  mapping network. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, our method exhibits superior
  performance over other approaches relying on estimated depth, and achieves comparable
  accuracy to methods utilizing ground truth depth on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
