title: 'SoftManiSim: A Fast Simulation Framework for Multi-Segment Continuum Manipulators
  Tailored for Robot Learning'
abstract: This paper introduces SoftManiSim, a novel simulation framework for multi-segment
  continuum manipulators. Existing continuum robot simulators often rely on simplifying
  assumptions, such as constant curvature bending or ignoring contact forces, to meet
  real-time simulation and training demands. To bridge this gap, we propose a robust
  and rapid mathematical model for continuum robots at the core of SoftManiSim, ensuring
  precise and adaptable simulations. The framework can integrate with various rigid-body
  robots, increasing its utility across different robotic platforms. SoftManiSim supports
  parallel operations for simultaneous simulations of multiple robots and generates
  synthetic data essential for training deep reinforcement learning models. This capability
  enhances the development and optimization of control strategies in dynamic environments.
  Extensive simulations validate the framework’s effectiveness, demonstrating its
  capabilities in handling complex robotic interactions and tasks. We also present
  real robot validation to showcase the simulator’s practical applicability and accuracy
  in real-world settings. To our knowledge, SoftManiSim is the first open-source real-time
  simulator capable of modeling continuum robot behavior under dynamic point/distributed
  loading. It enables rapid deployment in reinforcement learning and machine learning
  applications. This simulation framework can be downloaded from https://github.com/MohammadKasaei/SoftManiSim.
