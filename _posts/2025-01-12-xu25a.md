title: Flow as the Cross-domain Manipulation Interface
abstract: 'We present Im2Flow2Act, a scalable learning framework that enables robots
  to acquire real-world manipulation skills without the need of real-world robot training
  data. The key idea behind Im2Flow2Act is to use object flow as the manipulation
  interface, bridging domain gaps between different embodiments (i.e., human and robot)
  and training environments (i.e., real-world and simulated). Im2Flow2Act comprises
  two components: a flow generation network and a flow-conditioned policy. The flow
  generation network, trained on human demonstration videos, generates object flow
  from the initial scene image, conditioned on the task description. The flow-conditioned
  policy, trained on simulated robot play data, maps the generated object flow to
  robot actions to realize the desired object movements. By using flow as input, this
  policy can be directly deployed in the real world with a minimal sim-to-real gap.
  By leveraging real-world human videos and simulated robot play data, we bypass the
  challenges of teleoperating physical robots in the real world, resulting in a scalable
  system for diverse tasks. We demonstrate Im2Flow2Actâ€™s capabilities in a variety
  of real-world tasks, including the manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable
  objects.'
