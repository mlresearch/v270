title: 'Gameplay Filters: Robust Zero-Shot Safety through Adversarial Imagination'
abstract: 'Despite the impressive recent advances in learning-based robot control,
  ensuring robustness to out-of-distribution conditions remains an open challenge.
  Safety filters can, in principle, keep arbitrary control policies from incurring
  catastrophic failures by overriding unsafe actions, but existing solutions for complex
  (e.g., legged) robot dynamics do not span the full motion envelope and instead rely
  on local, reduced-order models. These filters tend to overly restrict agility and
  can still fail when perturbed away from nominal conditions. This paper presents
  the gameplay filter, a new class of predictive safety filter that continually plays
  out hypothetical matches between its simulation-trained safety strategy and a virtual
  adversary co-trained to invoke worst-case events and sim-to-real error, and precludes
  actions that would cause failures down the line. We demonstrate the scalability
  and robustness of the approach with a first-of-its-kind full-order safety filter
  for (36-D) quadrupedal dynamics. Physical experiments on two different quadruped
  platforms demonstrate the superior zero-shot effectiveness of the gameplay filter
  under large perturbations such as tugging and unmodeled terrain. Experiment videos
  and open-source software are available online: https://saferobotics.org/research/gameplay-filter'
