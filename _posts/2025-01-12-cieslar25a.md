title: Learning Long-Horizon Action Dependencies in Sampling-Based Bilevel Planning
abstract: Autonomous robots will need the ability to make task and motion plans that
  involve long sequences of actions, e.g. to prepare a meal. One challenge is that
  the feasibility of actions late in the plan may depend on much earlier actions.
  This issue is exacerbated if these dependencies exist at a purely geometric level,
  making them difficult to express for a task planner. Backtracking is a common technique
  to resolve such geometric dependencies, but its time complexity limits its applicability
  to short-horizon dependencies. We propose an approach to account for these dependencies
  by learning a search heuristic for task and motion planning. We evaluate our approach
  on five quasi-static simulated domains and show a substantial improvement in success
  rate over the baselines.
