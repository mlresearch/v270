title: Generalizing End-To-End Autonomous Driving In Real-World Environments Using
  Zero-Shot LLMs
abstract: Traditional autonomous driving methods adopt modular design, decomposing
  tasks into sub-tasks, including perception, prediction, planning, and control. In
  contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving directly outputs actions from raw sensor
  data, avoiding error accumulation. However, training an end-to-end model requires
  a comprehensive dataset. Without adequate data, the end-to-end model exhibits poor
  generalization capabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied
  to enhance the generalization property of end-to-end driving models. Most studies
  explore LLMs in an open-loop manner, where the output actions are compared to those
  of experts without direct activation in the real world. Other studies in closed-loop
  settings examine their results in simulated environments. In comparison, this paper
  proposes an efficient architecture that integrates multimodal LLMs into end-to-end
  real-world driving models in a closed-loop setting. The LLM periodically takes raw
  sensor data to generate high-level driving instructions. In our architecture, LLMs
  can effectively guide the end-to-end model, even at a slower rate than the raw sensor
  data, because updates arenâ€™t needed every time frame. This architecture relaxes
  the trade-off between the latency and inference quality of the LLM. It also allows
  us to choose a wide variety of LLMs to improve high-level driving instructions and
  minimize fine-tuning costs. Consequently, our architecture reduces the data collection
  requirements because the LLMs do not directly output actions, and we only need to
  train a simple imitation learning model to output actions. In our experiments, the
  training data for the end-to-end model in a real-world environment consists of only
  simple obstacle configurations with one traffic cone, while the test environment
  is more complex and contains different types of obstacles. Experiments show that
  the proposed architecture enhances the generalization capabilities of the end-to-end
  model even without fine-tuning the LLM.
