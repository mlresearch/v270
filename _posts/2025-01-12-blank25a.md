title: Scaling Robot Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Labeling with Foundation Models
abstract: 'A central challenge towards developing robots that can relate human language
  to their perception and actions is the scarcity of natural language annotations
  in diverse robot datasets. Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language
  instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled
  instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce NILS: Natural
  language Instruction Labeling for Scalability. NILS automatically labels uncurated,
  long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention.
  NILS combines pre-trained vision-language foundation models in a sophisticated,
  carefully considered manner in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric
  changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately
  label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2 and a kitchen play dataset show
  that NILS is able to autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled
  and unstructured datasets, while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced
  human annotations.'
