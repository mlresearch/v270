title: Language-guided Manipulator Motion Planning with Bounded Task Space
abstract: Language-based robot control is a powerful and versatile method to control
  a robot manipulator where large language models (LLMs) are used to reason about
  the environment. However, the generated robot motions by these controllers often
  lack safety and performance, resulting in jerky movements. In this work, a novel
  modular framework for zero-shot motion planning for manipulation tasks is developed.
  The modular components do not require any motion-planning-specific training. An
  LLM is combined with a vision model to create Python code that interacts with a
  novel path planner, which creates a piecewise linear reference path with bounds
  around the path that ensure safety. An optimization-based planner, the BoundMPC
  framework, is utilized to execute optimal, safe, and collision-free trajectories
  along the reference path. The effectiveness of the approach is shown on various
  everyday manipulation tasks in simulation and experiment, shown in the video at
  www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d2.
