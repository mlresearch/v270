title: 'ClutterGen: A Cluttered Scene Generator for Robot Learning'
abstract: We introduce ClutterGen, a physically compliant simulation scene generator
  capable of producing highly diverse, cluttered, and stable scenes for robot learning.
  Generating such scenes is challenging as each object must adhere to physical laws
  like gravity and collision. As the number of objects increases, finding valid poses
  becomes more difficult, necessitating significant human engineering effort, which
  limits the diversity of the scenes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement
  learning method that can be trained with physics-based reward signals provided by
  the simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that ClutterGen can generate cluttered
  object layouts with up to ten objects on confined table surfaces. Additionally,
  our policy design explicitly encourages the diversity of the generated scenes for
  open-ended generation. Our real-world robot results show that ClutterGen can be
  directly used for clutter rearrangement and stable placement policy training.
