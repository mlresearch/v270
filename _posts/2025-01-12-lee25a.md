title: 'InterACT: Inter-dependency Aware Action Chunking with Hierarchical Attention
  Transformers for Bimanual Manipulation'
abstract: 'We present InterACT: Inter-dependency aware Action Chunking with Hierarchical
  Attention Transformers, a novel imitation learning framework for bimanual manipulation
  that integrates hierarchical attention to capture inter-dependencies between dual-arm
  joint states and visual inputs. InterACT consists of a Hierarchical Attention Encoder
  and a Multi-arm Decoder, both designed to enhance information aggregation and coordination.
  The encoder processes multi-modal inputs through segment-wise and cross-segment
  attention mechanisms, while the decoder leverages synchronization blocks to refine
  individual action predictions, providing the counterpartâ€™s prediction as context.
  Our experiments on a variety of simulated and real-world bimanual manipulation tasks
  demonstrate that InterACT significantly outperforms existing methods. Detailed ablation
  studies validate the contributions of key components of our work, including the
  impact of CLS tokens, cross-segment encoders, and synchronization blocks.'
