title: 'ALOHA Unleashed: A Simple Recipe for Robot Dexterity'
abstract: Recent work has shown promising results for learning end-to-end robot policies
  using imitation learning. In this work we address the question of how far can we
  push imitation learning for challenging dexterous manipulation tasks. We show that
  a simple recipe of large scale data collection on the ALOHA 2 platform, combined
  with expressive models such as Diffusion Policies, can be effective in learning
  challenging bimanual manipulation tasks involving deformable objects and complex
  contact rich dynamics. We demonstrate our recipe on 5 challenging real-world and
  3 simulated tasks and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines.
