title: '3D Diffuser Actor: Policy Diffusion with 3D Scene Representations'
abstract: Diffusion policies are conditional diffusion models that learn robot action
  distributions conditioned on the robot and environment state. They have recently
  shown to outperform both deterministic and alternative action distribution learning
  formulations. 3D robot policies use 3D scene feature representations aggregated
  from a single or multiple camera views using sensed depth. They have shown to generalize
  better than their 2D counterparts across camera viewpoints. We unify these two lines
  of work and present 3D Diffuser Actor , a neural policy equipped with a novel 3D
  denoising transformer that fuses information from the 3D visual scene, a language
  instruction and proprioception to predict the noise in noised 3D robot pose trajectories.
  3D Diffuser Actor sets a new state-of-the-art on RLBench with an absolute performance
  gain of 18.1% over the current SOTA on a multi-view setup and an absolute gain of
  13.1% on a single-view setup. On the CALVIN benchmark, it improves over the current
  SOTA by a 9% relative increase. It also learns to control a robot manipulator in
  the real world from a handful of demonstrations. Through thorough comparisons with
  the current SOTA policies and ablations of our model, we show 3D Diffuser Actor
  â€™s design choices dramatically outperform 2D representations, regression and classification
  objectives, absolute attentions, and holistic non-tokenized 3D scene embeddings.
