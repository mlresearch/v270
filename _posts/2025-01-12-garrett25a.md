title: 'SkillMimicGen: Automated Demonstration Generation for Efficient Skill Learning
  and Deployment'
abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective paradigm for
  robot manipulation, but acquiring large datasets is costly and resource-intensive,
  especially for long-horizon tasks. To address this issue, we propose SkillGen, an
  automated system for generating demonstration datasets from a few human demos. SkillGen
  segments human demos into manipulation skills, adapts these skills to new contexts,
  and stitches them together through free-space transit and transfer motion. We also
  propose a Hybrid Skill Policy (HSP) framework for learning skill initiation, control,
  and termination components from SkillGen datasets, enabling skills to be sequenced
  using motion planning at test-time. We demonstrate that SkillGen greatly improves
  data generation and policy learning performance over a state-of-the-art data generation
  framework, resulting in the capability produce data for large scene variations,
  including clutter, and agents that are on average 24% more successful. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of SkillGen by generating over 24K demonstrations across 18 task variants
  in simulation from just 60 human demonstrations, and training proficient, often
  near-perfect, HSP agents. Finally, we apply SkillGen to 3 real-world manipulation
  tasks and demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a long-horizon assembly
  task. Videos, and more at https://skillgen.github.io.
