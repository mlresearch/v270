title: Learning Transparent Reward Models via Unsupervised Feature Selection
abstract: In complex real-world tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous
  driving, collecting expert demonstrations is often more straightforward than specifying
  precise learning objectives and task descriptions. Learning from expert data can
  be achieved through behavioral cloning or by learning a reward function, i.e., inverse
  reinforcement learning. The latter allows for training with additional data outside
  the training distribution, guided by the inferred reward function. We propose a
  novel approach to construct compact and interpretable reward models from automatically
  selected state features. These inferred rewards have an explicit form and enable
  the learning of policies that closely match expert behavior by training standard
  reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch. We validate our methodâ€™s performance
  in various robotic environments with continuous and high-dimensional state spaces.
