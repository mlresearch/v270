title: Autonomous Interactive Correction MLLM for Robust Robotic Manipulation
abstract: 'The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems
  to interact stably with real-life objects. Observing the generalization and reasoning
  capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have
  aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly. However, these
  methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM,
  with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses which
  is particularly prone to occur during articulated object manipulation. To address
  this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes
  use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions
  for articulated object. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire
  both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities. We design two
  types of prompt instructions for interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight
  unmovable parts for position correction, and 2) textual descriptions to indicate
  potential directions for rotation correction. During inference, a Feedback Information
  Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM
  to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts. To further
  enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables
  AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration. Finally, extensive
  experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate
  the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct
  failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts.'
