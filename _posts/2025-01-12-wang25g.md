title: 'I Can Tell What I am Doing: Toward Real-World Natural Language Grounding of
  Robot Experiences'
abstract: Understanding robot behaviors and experiences through natural language is
  crucial for developing intelligent and transparent robotic systems. Recent advancement
  in large language models (LLMs) makes it possible to translate complex, multi-modal
  robotic experiences into coherent, human-readable narratives. However, grounding
  real-world robot experiences into natural language is challenging due to many reasons,
  such as multi-modal nature of data, differing sample rates, and data volume. We
  introduce RONAR, an LLM-based system that generates natural language narrations
  from robot experiences, aiding in behavior announcement, failure analysis, and human
  interaction to recover failure. Evaluated across various scenarios, RONAR outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods and improves failure recovery efficiency. Our contributions
  include a multi-modal framework for robot experience narration, a comprehensive
  real-robot dataset, and empirical evidence of RONARâ€™s effectiveness in enhancing
  user experience in system transparency and failure analysis.
