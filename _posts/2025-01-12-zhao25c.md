title: Transferable Tactile Transformers for Representation Learning Across Diverse
  Sensors and Tasks
abstract: 'This paper presents T3: Transferable Tactile Transformers, a framework
  for tactile representation learning that scales across multi-sensors and multi-tasks.T3
  is designed to overcome the contemporary issue that camera-based tactile sensing
  is extremely heterogeneous, i.e. sensors are built into different form factors,
  and existing datasets were collected for disparate tasks. T3 captures the shared
  latent information across different sensor-task pairings by constructing a shared
  trunk transformer with sensor-specific encoders and task-specific decoders. The
  pre-training of T3utilizes a novel Foundation Tactile (FoTa) dataset, which is aggregated
  from several open-sourced datasets and it contains over 3 million data points gathered
  from 13 sensors and 11 tasks. FoTa is the largest and most diverse dataset in tactile
  sensing to date and it is made publicly available in a unified format. Across various
  sensors and tasks, experiments show that T3 pre-trained with FoTa achieved zero-shot
  transferability in certain sensor-task pairings, can be further fine-tuned with
  small amounts of domain-specific data, and its performance scales with bigger network
  sizes. T3 is also effective as a tactile encoder for long horizon contact-rich manipulation.
  Results from sub-millimeter multi-pin electronics insertion tasks show that T3 achieved
  a task success rate 25% higher than that of policies trained with tactile encoders
  trained from scratch, or 53% higher than without tactile sensing. Data, code, and
  model checkpoints are open-sourced at https://t3.alanz.info.'
