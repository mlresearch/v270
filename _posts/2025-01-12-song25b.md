title: 'Implicit Grasp Diffusion: Bridging the Gap between Dense Prediction and Sampling-based
  Grasping'
abstract: 'There are two dominant approaches in modern robot grasp planning: dense
  prediction and sampling-based methods. Dense prediction calculates viable grasps
  across the robotâ€™s view but is limited to predicting one grasp per voxel. Sampling-based
  methods, on the other hand, encode multi-modal grasp distributions, allowing for
  different grasp approaches at a point. However, these methods rely on a global latent
  representation, which struggles to represent the entire field of view, resulting
  in coarse grasps. To address this, we introduce \emph{Implicit Grasp Diffusion}
  (IGD), which combines the strengths of both methods by using implicit neural representations
  to extract detailed local features and sampling grasps from diffusion models conditioned
  on these features. Evaluations on clutter removal tasks in both simulated and real-world
  environments show that IGD delivers high accuracy, noise resilience, and multi-modal
  grasp pose capabilities.'
