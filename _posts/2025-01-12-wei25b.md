title: Safe Bayesian Optimization for the Control of High-Dimensional Embodied Systems
abstract: Learning to move is a primary goal for animals and robots, where ensuring
  safety is often important when optimizing control policies on the embodied systems.
  For complex tasks such as the control of human or humanoid control, the high-dimensional
  parameter space adds complexity to the safe optimization effort. Current safe exploration
  algorithms exhibit inefficiency and may even become infeasible with large high-dimensional
  input spaces. Furthermore, existing high-dimensional constrained optimization methods
  neglect safety in the search process. In this paper, we propose High-dimensional
  Safe Bayesian Optimization with local optimistic exploration (HdSafeBO), a novel
  approach designed to handle high-dimensional sampling problems under probabilistic
  safety constraints. We introduce a local optimistic strategy to efficiently and
  safely optimize the objective function, providing a probabilistic safety guarantee
  and a cumulative safety violation bound. Through the use of isometric embedding,
  HdSafeBO addresses problems ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dimensions
  while maintaining safety guarantees. To our knowledge, HdSafeBO is the first algorithm
  capable of optimizing the control of high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems with
  high safety probability. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of HdSafeBO
  through its use in the safe online optimization of neural stimulation-induced human
  motion control.
