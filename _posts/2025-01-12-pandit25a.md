title: Learning Decentralized Multi-Biped Control for Payload Transport
abstract: Payload transport over flat terrain via multi-wheel robot carriers is well-understood,
  highly effective, and configurable. In this paper, our goal is to provide similar
  effectiveness and configurability for transport over rough terrain that is more
  suitable for legs rather than wheels. For this purpose, we consider multi-biped
  robot carriers, where wheels are replaced by multiple bipedal robots attached to
  the carrier. Our main contribution is to design a decentralized controller for such
  systems that can be effectively applied to varying numbers and configurations of
  rigidly attached bipedal robots without retraining. We present a reinforcement learning
  approach for training the controller in simulation that supports transfer to the
  real world. Our experiments in simulation provide quantitative metrics showing the
  effectiveness of the approach over a wide variety of simulated transport scenarios.
  In addition, we demonstrate the controller in the real-world for systems composed
  of two and three Cassie robots. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a
  scalable multi-biped payload transport system.
