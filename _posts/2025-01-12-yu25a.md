title: Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator for Autonomous Uneven Terrain Navigation
abstract: 'Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for
  developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and
  unstructured terrains. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential
  elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy
  training, and (2) the deployment of an environment generator tasked with crafting
  terrains that are sufficiently challenging yet attainable, thereby facilitating
  continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of environment generation often
  rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and
  realism. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator (ADTG),
  a novel method that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to
  dynamically expand an existing training environment by adding more diverse and complex
  terrains tailored to the current policy. Unlike conventional methods, ADTG adapts
  the terrain complexity and variety based on the evolving capabilities of the current
  policy. This is achieved through two primary mechanisms: First, by blending terrains
  from the initial dataset within their latent spaces using performance-informed weights,
  ADTG creates terrains that suitably challenge the policy. Secondly, by manipulating
  the initial noise in the diffusion process, ADTG seamlessly shifts between creating
  similar terrains for fine-tuning the current policy and entirely novel ones for
  expanding training diversity. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADTG
  outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular
  navigation methods.'
