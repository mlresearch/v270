title: 'AnyRotate: Gravity-Invariant In-Hand Object Rotation with Sim-to-Real Touch'
abstract: Human hands are capable of in-hand manipulation in the presence of different
  hand motions. For a robot hand, harnessing rich tactile information to achieve this
  level of dexterity still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
  AnyRotate, a system for gravity-invariant multi-axis in-hand object rotation using
  dense featured sim-to-real touch. We tackle this problem by training a dense tactile
  policy in simulation and present a sim-to-real method for rich tactile sensing to
  achieve zero-shot policy transfer. Our formulation allows the training of a unified
  policy to rotate unseen objects about arbitrary rotation axes in any hand direction.
  In our experiments, we highlight the benefit of capturing detailed contact information
  when handling objects of varying properties. Interestingly, we found rich multi-fingered
  tactile sensing can detect unstable grasps and provide a reactive behavior that
  improves the robustness of the policy.
