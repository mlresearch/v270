title: 'Hint-AD: Holistically Aligned Interpretability in End-to-End Autonomous Driving'
abstract: End-to-end architectures in autonomous driving (AD) face a significant challenge
  in interpretability, impeding human-AI trust. Human-friendly natural language has
  been explored for tasks such as driving explanation and 3D captioning. However,
  previous works primarily focused on the paradigm of declarative interpretability,
  where the natural language interpretations are not grounded in the intermediate
  outputs of AD systems, making the interpretations only declarative. In contrast,
  aligned interpretability establishes a connection between language and the intermediate
  outputs of AD systems. Here we introduce Hint-AD, an integrated AD-language system
  that generates language aligned with the holistic perception-prediction-planning
  outputs of the AD model. By incorporating the intermediate outputs and a holistic
  token mixer sub-network for effective feature adaptation, Hint-AD achieves desirable
  accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results in driving language tasks including
  driving explanation, 3D dense captioning, and command prediction. To facilitate
  further study on driving explanation task on nuScenes, we also introduce a human-labeled
  dataset, Nu-X. Codes, dataset, and models are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hint-AD-1385/.
