title: 'LLARVA: Vision-Action Instruction Tuning Enhances Robot Learning'
abstract: In recent years, instruction-tuned Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
  successful at several tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering;
  yet leveraging these models remains an open question for robotics. Prior LMMs for
  robotics applications have been extensively trained on language and action data,
  but their ability to generalize in different settings has often been less than desired.
  To address this, we introduce LLARVA, a model trained with a novel instruction tuning
  method that leverages structured prompts to unify a range of robotic learning tasks,
  scenarios, and environments. Additionally, we show that predicting intermediate
  2-D representations, which we refer to as *visual traces*, can help further align
  vision and action spaces for robot learning. We generate 8.5M image-visual trace
  pairs from the Open X-Embodiment dataset in order to pre-train our model, and we
  evaluate on 12 different tasks in the RLBench simulator as well as a physical Franka
  Emika Panda 7-DoF robot. Our experiments yield strong performance, demonstrating
  that LLARVA — using 2-D and language representations — performs well compared to
  several contemporary baselines, and can generalize across various robot environments
  and configurations.
