title: 'FetchBench: A Simulation Benchmark for Robot Fetching'
abstract: Fetching, which includes approaching, grasping, and retrieving, is a critical
  challenge for robot manipulation tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on table-top
  scenarios, which do not adequately capture the complexities of environments where
  both grasping and planning are essential. To address this gap, we propose a new
  benchmark FetchBench, featuring diverse procedural scenes that integrate both grasping
  and motion planning challenges. Additionally, FetchBench includes a data generation
  pipeline that collects successful fetch trajectories for use in imitation learning
  methods. We implement multiple baselines from the traditional sense-plan-act pipeline
  to end-to-end behavior models. Our empirical analysis reveals that these methods
  achieve a maximum success rate of only 20%, indicating substantial room for improvement.
  Additionally, we identify key bottlenecks within the sense-plan-act pipeline and
  make recommendations based on the systematic analysis.
