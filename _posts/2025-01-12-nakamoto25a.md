title: 'Steering Your Generalists: Improving Robotic Foundation Models via Value Guidance'
abstract: 'Large, general-purpose robotic policies trained on diverse demonstration
  datasets have been shown to be remarkably effective both for controlling a variety
  of robots in a range of different scenes, and for acquiring broad repertoires of
  manipulation skills. However, the data that such policies are trained on is generally
  of mixed quality â€“ not only are human-collected demonstrations unlikely to perform
  the task perfectly, but the larger the dataset is, the harder it is to curate only
  the highest quality examples. It also remains unclear how optimal data from one
  embodiment is for training on another embodiment. In this paper, we present a general
  and broadly applicable approach that enhances the performance of such generalist
  robot policies at deployment time by re-ranking their actions according to a value
  function learned via offline RL. This approach, which we call Value-Guided Policy
  Steering (V-GPS), is compatible with a wide range of different generalist policies,
  without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. We show that
  the same value function can improve the performance of five different state-of-the-art
  policies with different architectures, even though they were trained on distinct
  datasets, attaining consistent performance improvement on multiple robotic platforms
  across a total of 12 tasks. Code and videos can be found at: https://nakamotoo.github.io/V-GPS'
