title: 'Gentle Manipulation of Tree Branches: A Contact-Aware Policy Learning Approach'
abstract: Learning to interact with deformable tree branches with minimal damage is
  challenging due to their intricate geometry and inscrutable dynamics. Furthermore,
  traditional vision-based modelling systems suffer from implicit occlusions in dense
  foliage, severely changing lighting conditions, and limited field of view, in addition
  to having a significant computational burden preventing real-time deployment.In
  this work, we simulate a procedural forest with realistic, self-similar branching
  structures derived from a parametric L-system model, actuated with crude spring
  abstractions, mirroring real-world variations with domain randomisation over the
  morphological and dynamic attributes. We then train a novel Proprioceptive Contact-Aware
  Policy (PCAP) for a reach task using reinforcement learning, aided by a whole-arm
  contact detection classifier and reward engineering, without external vision, tactile,
  or torque sensing. The agent deploys novel strategies to evade and mitigate contact
  impact, favouring a reactive exploration of the task space. Finally, we demonstrate
  that the learned behavioural patterns can be transferred zero-shot from simulation
  to real, allowing the arm to navigate around real branches with unseen topology
  and variable occlusions while minimising the contact forces and expected ruptures.
