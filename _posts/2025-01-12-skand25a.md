title: Simple Masked Training Strategies Yield Control Policies That Are Robust to
  Sensor Failure
abstract: Sensor failure is common when robots are deployed in the real world, as
  sensors naturally wear out over time. Such failures can lead to catastrophic outcomes,
  including damage to the robot from unexpected robot behaviors such as falling during
  walking. Previous work has tried to address this problem by recovering missing sensor
  values from the history of states or by adapting learned control policies to handle
  corrupted sensors through fine-tuning during deployment. In this work, we propose
  training reinforcement learning (RL) policies that are robust to sensory failures.
  We use a multimodal encoder designed to account for these failures and a training
  strategy that randomly drops a subset of sensor modalities, similar to missing observations
  caused by failed sensors. We conduct evaluations across multiple tasks (bipedal
  locomotion and robotic manipulation) with varying robot embodiments in both simulation
  and the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results
  show that the proposed method produces robust RL policies that handle failures in
  both low-dimensional proprioceptive and high-dimensional visual modalities without
  a significant increase in training time or decrease in sample efficiency, making
  it a promising solution for learning RL policies robust to sensory failures.
