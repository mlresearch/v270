title: 'JA-TN: Pick-and-Place Towel Shaping from Crumpled States based on TransporterNet
  with Joint-Probability Action Inference'
abstract: Towel manipulation is a crucial step towards more general cloth manipulation.
  However, folding a towel from an arbitrarily crumpled state and recovering from
  a failed folding step remain critical challenges in robotics. We propose joint-probability
  action inference JA-TN, as a way to improve TransporterNet’s operational efficiency;
  to our knowledge, this is the first single data-driven policy to achieve various
  types of folding from most crumpled states. We present three benchmark domains with
  a set of shaping tasks and the corresponding oracle policies to facilitate the further
  development of the field. We also present a simulation-to-reality transfer procedure
  for vision-based deep learning controllers by processing and augmenting RGB and/or
  depth images. We also demonstrate JA-TN’s ability to integrate with a real camera
  and a UR3e robot arm, showcasing the method’s applicability to real-world tasks.
