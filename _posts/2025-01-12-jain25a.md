title: 'ANAVI: Audio Noise Awareness using Visual of Indoor environments for NAVIgation'
abstract: We propose Audio Noise Awareness using Visuals of Indoors for NAVIgation
  for quieter robot path planning. While humans are naturally aware of the noise they
  make and its impact on those around them, robots currently lack this awareness.
  A key challenge in achieving audio awareness for robots is estimating how loud will
  the robot’s actions be at a listener’s location? Since sound depends upon the geometry
  and material composition of rooms, we train the robot to passively perceive loudness
  using visual observations of indoor environments. To this end, we generate data
  on how loud an ‘impulse’ sounds at different listener locations in simulated homes,
  and train our Acoustic Noise Predictor (ANP). Next, we collect acoustic profiles
  corresponding to different actions for navigation. Unifying ANP with action acoustics,
  we demonstrate experiments with wheeled (Hello Robot Stretch) and legged (Unitree
  Go2) robots so that these robots adhere to the noise constraints of the environment.
  All simulated and real-world data, code and model checkpoints is released at https://anavi-corl24.github.io/.
