title: 'SLR: Learning Quadruped Locomotion without Privileged Information'
abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning control for quadruped robots often relies
  on privileged information, demanding meticulous selection and precise estimation,
  thereby imposing constraints on the development process. This work proposes a Self-learning
  Latent Representation (SLR) method, which achieves high-performance control policy
  learning without the need for privileged information. To enhance the credibility
  of our proposed method’s evaluation, SLR is compared with open-source code repositories
  of state-of-the-art algorithms, retaining the original authors’ configuration parameters.
  Across four repositories, SLR consistently outperforms the reference results. Ultimately,
  the trained policy and encoder empower the quadruped robot to navigate steps, climb
  stairs, ascend rocks, and traverse various challenging terrains.
