title: Learning Visuotactile Estimation and Control for Non-prehensile Manipulation
  under Occlusions
abstract: Manipulation without grasping, known as non-prehensile manipulation, is
  essential for dexterous robots in contact-rich environments, but presents many challenges
  relating with underactuation, hybrid-dynamics, and frictional uncertainty. Additionally,
  object occlusions in a scenario of contact uncertainty and where the motion of the
  object evolves independently from the robot becomes a critical problem, which previous
  literature fails to address. We present a method for learning visuotactile state
  estimators and uncertainty-aware control policies for non-prehensile manipulation
  under occlusions, by leveraging diverse interaction data from privileged policies
  trained in simulation. We formulate the estimator within a Bayesian deep learning
  framework, to model its uncertainty, and then train uncertainty-aware control policies
  by incorporating the pre-learned estimator into the reinforcement learning (RL)
  loop, both of which lead to significantly improved estimator and policy performance.
  Therefore, unlike prior non-prehensile research that relies on complex external
  perception set-ups, our method successfully handles occlusions after sim-to-real
  transfer to robotic hardware with a simple onboard camera.
