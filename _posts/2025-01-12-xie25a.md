title: 'DeliGrasp: Inferring Object Properties with LLMs for Adaptive Grasp Policies'
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) can provide rich physical descriptions of
  most worldly objects, allowing robots to achieve more informed and capable grasping.
  We leverage LLMs’ common sense physical reasoning and code-writing abilities to
  infer an object’s physical characteristics-mass $m$, friction coefficient $\mu$,
  and spring constant $k$-from a semantic description, and then translate those characteristics
  into an executable adaptive grasp policy. Using a two-finger gripper with a built-in
  depth camera that can control its torque by limiting motor current, we demonstrate
  that LLM-parameterized but first-principles grasp policies outperform both traditional
  adaptive grasp policies and direct LLM-as-code policies on a custom benchmark of
  12 delicate and deformable items including food, produce, toys, and other everyday
  items, spanning two orders of magnitude in mass and required pick-up force. We then
  improve property estimation and grasp performance on variable size objects with
  model finetuning on property-based comparisons and eliciting such comparisons via
  chain-of-thought prompting. We also demonstrate how compliance feedback from DeliGrasp
  policies can aid in downstream tasks such as measuring produce ripeness. Our code
