title: 'FlowRetrieval: Flow-Guided Data Retrieval for Few-Shot Imitation Learning'
abstract: 'Imitation learning policies in robotics tend to require an extensive amount
  of demonstrations. It is critical to develop few-shot adaptation strategies that
  rely only on a small amount of task-specific human demonstrations. Prior works focus
  on learning general policies from large scale dataset with diverse behaviors. Recent
  research has shown that directly retrieving relevant past experiences to augment
  policy learning has great promise in few-shot settings. However, existing data retrieval
  methods fall under two extremes: they either rely on the existence of exact same
  behaviors with visually similar scenes in the prior data, which is impractical to
  assume; or they retrieve based on semantic similarity of high-level language descriptions
  of the task, which might not be that informative about the shared behaviors or motions
  across tasks. In this work, we investigate how we can leverage motion similarity
  in the vast amount of cross-task data to improve few-shot imitation learning of
  the target task. Our key insight is that motion-similar data carry rich information
  about the effects of actions and object interactions that can be leveraged during
  few-shot adaptation. We propose FlowRetrieval, an approach that leverages optical
  flow representations for both extracting similar motions to target tasks from prior
  data, and for guiding learning of a policy that can maximally benefit from such
  data. Our results show FlowRetrieval significantly outperforms prior methods across
  simulated and real-world domains, achieving on average 27% higher success rate than
  the best retrieval-based prior method. In the Pen-in-Cup task with a real Franka
  Emika robot, FlowRetrieval achieves 3.7x the performance of the baseline learning
  from all prior and target data.'
