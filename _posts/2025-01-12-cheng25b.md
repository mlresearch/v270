title: 'Open-TeleVision: Teleoperation with Immersive Active Visual Feedback'
abstract: Teleoperation serves as a powerful method for collecting on-robot data essential
  for robot learning from demonstrations. The intuitiveness and ease of use of the
  teleoperation system are crucial for ensuring high-quality, diverse, and scalable
  data. To achieve this, we propose an immersive teleoperation system $\textbf{Open-TeleVision}$
  that allows operators to actively perceive the robot’s surroundings in a stereoscopic
  manner. Additionally, the system mirrors the operator’s arm and hand movements on
  the robot, creating an immersive experience as if the operator’s mind is transmitted
  to a robot embodiment. We validate the effectiveness of our system by collecting
  data and training imitation learning policies on four long-horizon, precise tasks
  (can sorting, can insertion, folding, and unloading) for 2 different humanoid robots
  and deploy them in the real world. The entire system will be open-sourced.
