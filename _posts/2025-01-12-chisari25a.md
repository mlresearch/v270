title: Learning Robotic Manipulation Policies from Point Clouds with Conditional Flow
  Matching
abstract: Learning from expert demonstrations is a popular approach to train robotic
  manipulation policies from limited data. However, imitation learning algorithms
  require a number of design choices ranging from the input modality, training objective,
  and 6-DoF end-effector pose representation. Diffusion-based methods have gained
  popularity as they allow to predict long horizon trajectories and handle multimodal
  action distributions. Recently, Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) (or Rectified Flow)
  has been proposed as a more flexible generalization of diffusion models. In this
  paper we investigate the application of CFM in the context of robotic policy learning,
  and specifically study the interplay with the other design choices required to build
  an imitation learning algorithm. We show that CFM gives the best performance when
  combined with point cloud input observations. Additionally, we study the feasibility
  of a CFM formulation on the SO(3) manifold and evaluate its suitability with a simplified
  example. We perform extensive experiments on RLBench which demonstrate that our
  proposed PointFlowMatch approach achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate
  of 67.8% over eight tasks, double the performance of the next best method.
