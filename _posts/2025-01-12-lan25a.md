title: 'DexCatch: Learning to Catch Arbitrary Objects with Dexterous Hands'
abstract: Achieving human-like dexterous manipulation remains a crucial area of research
  in robotics. Current research focuses on improving the success rate of pick-and-place
  tasks. Compared with pick-and-place, throwing-catching behavior has the potential
  to increase the speed of transporting objects to their destination. However, dynamic
  dexterous manipulation poses a major challenge for stable control due to a large
  number of dynamic contacts. In this paper, we propose a Learning-based framework
  for Throwing-Catching tasks using dexterous hands (LTC). Our method, LTC, achieves
  a 73% success rate across 45 scenarios (diverse hand poses and objects), and the
  learned policies demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer performance on unseen objects.
  Additionally, in tasks where the object in hand faces sideways, an extremely unstable
  scenario due to the lack of support from the palm, all baselines fail, while our
  method still achieves a success rate of over 60%.
