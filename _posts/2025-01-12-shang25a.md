title: 'Theia: Distilling Diverse Vision Foundation Models for Robot Learning'
abstract: Vision-based robot policy learning, which maps visual inputs to actions,
  necessitates a holistic understanding of diverse visual tasks beyond single-task
  needs like classification or segmentation. Inspired by this, we introduce Theia,
  a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf
  vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theiaâ€™s rich visual representations
  encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot
  learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally,
  we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that
  higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.
  Code, models, and demo are available at https://theia.theaiinstitute.com.
