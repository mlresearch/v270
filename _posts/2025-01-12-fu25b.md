title: 'Mobile ALOHA: Learning Bimanual Mobile Manipulation using Low-Cost Whole-Body
  Teleoperation'
abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations has shown impressive performance
  in robotics. However, most results focus on table-top manipulation, lacking the
  mobility and dexterity necessary for generally useful tasks. In this work, we develop
  a system for imitating mobile manipulation tasks that are bimanual and require whole-body
  control. We first present Mobile ALOHA, a low-cost and whole-body teleoperation
  system for data collection. It augments the ALOHA system with a mobile base, and
  a whole-body teleoperation interface. Using data collected with Mobile ALOHA, we
  then perform supervised behavior cloning and find that co-training with existing
  static ALOHA datasets boosts performance on mobile manipulation tasks. With 50 demonstrations
  for each task, co-training can increase success rates by up to 90%, allowing Mobile
  ALOHA to autonomously complete complex mobile manipulation tasks such as sauteing
  and serving a piece of shrimp, opening a two-door wall cabinet to store heavy cooking
  pots, calling and entering an elevator, and lightly rinsing a used pan using a kitchen
  faucet. We will open-source all the hardware and software implementations upon publication.
