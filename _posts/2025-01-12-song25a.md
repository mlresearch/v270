title: Learning Quadruped Locomotion Using Differentiable Simulation
abstract: This work explores the potential of using differentiable simulation for
  learning robot control. Differentiable simulation promises fast convergence and
  stable training by computing low-variance first-order gradients using the robot
  model. Still, so far, its usage for legged robots is limited to simulation. The
  main challenge lies in the complex optimization landscape of robotic tasks due to
  discontinuous dynamics. This work proposes a new differentiable simulation framework
  to overcome these challenges. The key idea involves decoupling the complex whole-body
  simulation, which may exhibit discontinuities due to contact into two separate continuous
  domains. Subsequently, we align the robot state resulting from the simplified model
  with a more precise, non-differentiable simulator to maintain sufficient simulation
  accuracy. Our framework enables learning quadruped walking in simulation in minutes
  without parallelization. When augmented with GPU parallelization, our approach allows
  the quadruped robot to master diverse locomotion skills on challenging terrains
  in minutes. We demonstrate that differentiable simulation outperforms a reinforcement
  learning algorithm (PPO) by achieving significantly better sample efficiency while
  maintaining its effectiveness in handling large-scale environments. Our policy achieves
  robust locomotion performance in the real world zero-shot.
