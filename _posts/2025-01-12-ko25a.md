title: A Planar-Symmetric SO(3) Representation for Learning Grasp Detection
abstract: Planar-symmetric hands, such as parallel grippers, are widely adopted in
  both research and industrial fields. Their symmetry, however, introduces ambiguity
  and discontinuity in the SO(3) representation, which hinders both the training and
  inference of neural network-based grasp detectors. We propose a novel SO(3) representation
  that can parametrize a pair of planar-symmetric poses with a single parameter set
  by leveraging the 2D Bingham distribution. We also detail a grasp detector based
  on our representation, which provides a more consistent rotation output. An intensive
  evaluation with multiple grippers and objects in both the simulation and the real
  world quantitatively shows our approachâ€™s contribution.
