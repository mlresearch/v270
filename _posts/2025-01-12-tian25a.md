title: View-Invariant Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesis
abstract: 'Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward developing
  generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be deployed on diverse
  embodiments, environments, and observational modalities remain elusive. In this
  work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale visual data of the world may
  be used to address one axis of variation for generalizable manipulation: observational
  viewpoint. Specifically, we study single-image novel view synthesis models, which
  learn 3D-aware scene-level priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate
  camera viewpoints given a single input image. For practical application to diverse
  robotic data, these models must operate *zero-shot*, performing view synthesis on
  unseen tasks and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within
  a simple data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA)
  to understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from
  single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies
  trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that they
  outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.'
