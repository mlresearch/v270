title: 'JointMotion: Joint Self-Supervision for Joint Motion Prediction'
abstract: We present JointMotion, a self-supervised pre-training method for joint
  motion prediction in self-driving vehicles. Our method jointly optimizes a scene-level
  objective connecting motion and environments, and an instance-level objective to
  refine learned representations. Scene-level representations are learned via non-contrastive
  similarity learning of past motion sequences and environment context. At the instance
  level, we use masked autoencoding to refine multimodal polyline representations.
  We complement this with an adaptive pre-training decoder that enables JointMotion
  to generalize across different environment representations, fusion mechanisms, and
  dataset characteristics. Notably, our method reduces the joint final displacement
  error of Wayformer, HPTR, and Scene Transformer models by 3%, 8%, and 12%, respectively;
  and enables transfer learning between the Waymo Open Motion and the Argoverse 2
  Motion Forecasting datasets.
