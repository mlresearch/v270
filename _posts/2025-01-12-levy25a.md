title: Learning to Walk from Three Minutes of Real-World Data with Semi-structured
  Dynamics Models
abstract: 'Traditionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods exploit
  neural networks as flexible function approximators to represent $\textit{a priori}$
  unknown environment dynamics. However, training data are typically scarce in practice,
  and these black-box models often fail to generalize. Modeling architectures that
  leverage known physics can substantially reduce the complexity of system-identification,
  but break down in the face of complex phenomena such as contact. We introduce a
  novel framework for learning semi-structured dynamics models for contact-rich systems
  which seamlessly integrates structured first principles modeling techniques with
  black-box auto-regressive models. Specifically, we develop an ensemble of probabilistic
  models to estimate external forces, conditioned on historical observations and actions,
  and integrate these predictions using known Lagrangian dynamics. With this semi-structured
  approach, we can make accurate long-horizon predictions with substantially less
  data than prior methods. We leverage this capability and propose Semi-Structured
  Reinforcement Learning ($\texttt{SSRL}$) a simple model-based learning framework
  which pushes the sample complexity boundary for real-world learning. We validate
  our approach on a real-world Unitree Go1 quadruped robot, learning dynamic gaits
  – from scratch – on both hard and soft surfaces with just a few minutes of real-world
  data. Video and code are available at: https://sites.google.com/utexas.edu/ssrl'
