title: 'HYPERmotion: Learning Hybrid Behavior Planning for Autonomous Loco-manipulation'
abstract: 'Enabling robots to autonomously perform hybrid motions in diverse environments
  can be beneficial for long-horizon tasks such as material handling, household chores,
  and work assistance. This requires extensive exploitation of intrinsic motion capabilities,
  extraction of affordances from rich environmental information, and planning of physical
  interaction behaviors. Despite recent progress has demonstrated impressive humanoid
  whole-body control abilities, they struggle to achieve versatility and adaptability
  for new tasks. In this work, we propose HYPERmotion, a framework that learns, selects
  and plans behaviors based on tasks in different scenarios. We combine reinforcement
  learning with whole-body optimization to generate motion for 38 actuated joints
  and create a motion library to store the learned skills. We apply the planning and
  reasoning features of the large language models (LLMs) to complex loco-manipulation
  tasks, constructing a hierarchical task graph that comprises a series of primitive
  behaviors to bridge lower-level execution with higher-level planning. By leveraging
  the interaction of distilled spatial geometry and 2D observation with a visual language
  model (VLM) to ground knowledge into a robotic morphology selector to choose appropriate
  actions in single- or dual-arm, legged or wheeled locomotion. Experiments in simulation
  and real-world show that learned motions can efficiently adapt to new tasks, demonstrating
  high autonomy from free-text commands in unstructured scenes. Videos and website:
