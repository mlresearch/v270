title: 'Unpacking Failure Modes of Generative Policies: Runtime Monitoring of Consistency
  and Progress'
abstract: 'Robot behavior policies trained via imitation learning are prone to failure
  under conditions that deviate from their training data. Thus, algorithms that monitor
  learned policies at test time and provide early warnings of failure are necessary
  to facilitate scalable deployment. We propose Sentinel, a runtime monitoring framework
  that splits the detection of failures into two complementary categories: 1) Erratic
  failures, which we detect using statistical measures of temporal action consistency,
  and 2) task progression failures, where we use Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
  detect when the policy confidently and consistently takes actions that do not solve
  the task. Our approach has two key strengths. First, because learned policies exhibit
  diverse failure modes, combining complementary detectors leads to significantly
  higher accuracy at failure detection. Second, using a statistical temporal action
  consistency measure ensures that we quickly detect when multimodal, generative policies
  exhibit erratic behavior at negligible computational cost. In contrast, we only
  use VLMs to detect modes that are less time-sensitive. We demonstrate our approach
  in the context of diffusion policies trained on robotic mobile manipulation domains
  in both simulation and the real world. By unifying temporal consistency detection
  and VLM runtime monitoring, Sentinel detects 18% more failures than using either
  of the two detectors alone and significantly outperforms baselines, thus highlighting
  the importance of assigning specialized detectors to complementary categories of
  failure. Qualitative results are made available at sites.google.com/stanford.edu/sentinel.'
