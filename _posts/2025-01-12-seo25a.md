title: Continuous Control with Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Despite recent advances in improving the sample-efficiency of reinforcement
  learning (RL) algorithms, designing an RL algorithm that can be practically deployed
  in real-world environments remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Coarse-to-fine
  Reinforcement Learning (CRL), a framework that trains RL agents to zoom-into a continuous
  action space in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the use of stable, sample-efficient
  value-based RL algorithms for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Our key idea
  is to train agents that output actions by iterating the procedure of (i) discretizing
  the continuous action space into multiple intervals and (ii) selecting the interval
  with the highest Q-value to further discretize at the next level. We then introduce
  a concrete, value-based algorithm within the CRL framework called Coarse-to-fine
  Q-Network (CQN). Our experiments demonstrate that CQN significantly outperforms
  RL and behavior cloning baselines on 20 sparsely-rewarded RLBench manipulation tasks
  with a modest number of environment interactions and expert demonstrations. We also
  show that CQN robustly learns to solve real-world manipulation tasks within a few
  minutes of online training.
