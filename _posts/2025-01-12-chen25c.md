title: Region-aware Grasp Framework with Normalized Grasp Space for Efficient 6-DoF
  Grasping
abstract: A series of region-based methods succeed in extracting regional features
  and enhancing grasp detection quality. However, faced with a cluttered scene with
  potential collision, the definition of the grasp-relevant region stays inconsistent.
  In this paper, we propose Normalized Grasp Space (NGS) from a novel region-aware
  viewpoint, unifying the grasp representation within a normalized regional space
  and benefiting the generalizability of methods. Leveraging the NGS, we find that
  CNNs are underestimated for 3D feature extraction and 6-DoF grasp detection in clutter
  scenes and build a highly efficient Region-aware Normalized Grasp Network (RNGNet).
  Experiments on the public benchmark show that our method achieves significant >20
  % performance gains while attaining a real-time inference speed of approximately
  50 FPS. Real-world cluttered scene clearance experiments underscore the effectiveness
  of our method. Further, human-to-robot handover and dynamic object grasping experiments
  demonstrate the potential of our proposed method for closed-loop grasping in dynamic
  scenarios.
