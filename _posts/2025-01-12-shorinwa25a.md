title: 'Splat-MOVER: Multi-Stage, Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation via Editable
  Gaussian Splatting'
abstract: 'We present Splat-MOVER, a modular robotics stack for open-vocabulary robotic
  manipulation, which leverages the editability of Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) scene
  representations to enable multi-stage manipulation tasks. Splat-MOVER consists of:
  (i) ASK-Splat, a GSplat representation that distills semantic and grasp affordance
  features into the 3D scene. ASK-Splat enables geometric, semantic, and affordance
  understanding of 3D scenes, which is critical for many robotics tasks; (ii) SEE-Splat,
  a real-time scene-editing module using 3D semantic masking and infilling to visualize
  the motions of objects that result from robot interactions in the real-world. SEE-Splat
  creates a “digital twin” of the evolving environment throughout the manipulation
  task; and (iii) Grasp-Splat, a grasp generation module that uses ASK-Splat and SEE-Splat
  to propose affordance-aligned candidate grasps for open-world objects. ASK-Splat
  is trained in real-time from RGB images in a brief scanning phase prior to operation,
  while SEE-Splat and Grasp-Splat run in real-time during operation. We demonstrate
  the superior performance of Splat-MOVER in hardware experiments on a Kinova robot
  compared to two recent baselines in four single-stage, open-vocabulary manipulation
  tasks. In addition, we demonstrate Splat-MOVER in four multi-stage manipulation
  tasks, using the edited scene to reflect changes due to prior manipulation stages,
  which is not possible with existing baselines. Video demonstrations and the code
  for the project are available at https://splatmover.github.io.'
