title: Goal-Reaching Policy Learning from Non-Expert Observations via Effective Subgoal
  Guidance
abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of long-horizon goal-reaching
  policy learning from non-expert, action-free observation data. Unlike fully labeled
  expert data, our data is more accessible and avoids the costly process of action
  labeling. Additionally, compared to online learning, which often involves aimless
  exploration, our data provides useful guidance for more efficient exploration. To
  achieve our goal, we propose a novel subgoal guidance learning strategy. The motivation
  behind this strategy is that long-horizon goals offer limited guidance for efficient
  exploration and accurate state transition. We develop a diffusion strategy-based
  high-level policy to generate reasonable subgoals as waypoints, preferring states
  that more easily lead to the final goal. Additionally, we learn state-goal value
  functions to encourage efficient subgoal reaching. These two components naturally
  integrate into the off-policy actor-critic framework, enabling efficient goal attainment
  through informative exploration. We evaluate our method on complex robotic navigation
  and manipulation tasks, demonstrating a significant performance advantage over existing
  methods. Our ablation study further shows that our method is robust to observation
  data with various corruptions.
