title: Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model for Sensor-less Robot Manipulator Design
abstract: We present Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model (DGDM), a data-driven framework
  for generating task-specific manipulator designs without task-specific training.
  Given object shapes and task specifications, DGDM generates sensor-less manipulator
  designs that can blindly manipulate objects towards desired motions and poses using
  an open-loop parallel motion. This framework 1) flexibly represents manipulation
  tasks as interaction profiles, 2) represents the design space using a geometric
  diffusion model, and 3) efficiently searches this design space using the gradients
  provided by a dynamics network trained without any task information. We evaluate
  DGDM on various manipulation tasks ranging from shifting/rotating objects to converging
  objects to a specific pose. Our generated designs outperform optimization-based
  and unguided diffusion baselines relatively by 31.5% and 45.3% on average success
  rate. With the ability to generate a new design within 0.8s, DGDM facilitates rapid
  design iteration and enhances the adoption of data-driven approaches for robot mechanism
  design. Qualitative results are best viewed on our project website https://dgdmcorl.github.io.
