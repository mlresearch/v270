title: Contrast Sets for Evaluating Language-Guided Robot Policies
abstract: Robot evaluations in language-guided, real world settings are time-consuming
  and often sample only a small space of potential instructions across complex scenes.
  In this work, we introduce contrast sets for robotics as an approach to make small,
  but specific, perturbations to otherwise independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.)
  test instances. We investigate the relationship between experimenter effort to carry
  out an evaluation and the resulting estimated test performance as well as the insights
  that can be drawn from performance on perturbed instances. We use contrast sets
  to characterize policies at reduced experimenter effort in both a simulated manipulation
  task and a physical robot vision-and-language navigation task. We encourage the
  use of contrast set evaluations as a more informative alternative to small scale,
  i.i.d. demonstrations on physical robots, and as a scalable alternative to industry-scale
  real world evaluations.
