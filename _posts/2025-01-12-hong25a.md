title: Learning a Distributed Hierarchical Locomotion Controller for Embodied Cooperation
abstract: In this work, we propose a distributed hierarchical locomotion control strategy
  for whole-body cooperation and demonstrate the potential for migration into large
  numbers of agents. Our method utilizes a hierarchical structure to break down complex
  tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. By incorporating spatiotemporal continuity
  features, we establish the sequential logic necessary for causal inference and cooperative
  behaviour in sequential tasks, thereby facilitating efficient and coordinated control
  strategies. Through training within this framework, we demonstrate enhanced adaptability
  and cooperation, leading to superior performance in task completion compared to
  the original methods. Moreover, we construct a set of environments as the benchmark
  for embodied cooperation.
