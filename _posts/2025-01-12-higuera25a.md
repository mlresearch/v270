title: 'Sparsh: Self-supervised touch representations for vision-based tactile sensing'
abstract: 'In this work, we introduce general purpose touch representations for the
  increasingly accessible class of vision-based tactile sensors. Such sensors have
  led to many recent advances in robot manipulation as they markedly complement vision,
  yet solutions today often rely on task and sensor specific handcrafted perception
  models. Collecting real data at scale with task centric ground truth labels, like
  contact forces and slip, is a challenge further compounded by sensors of various
  form factor differing in aspects like lighting and gel markings. To tackle this,
  we turn to self-supervised learning (SSL) that has demonstrated remarkable performance
  in computer vision. We present Sparsh, a family of SSL models that can support various
  vision-based tactile sensors, alleviating the need for custom labels through pre-training
  on 460k+ tactile images with masking and self-distillation in pixel and latent spaces.
  We also build TacBench, to facilitate standardized benchmarking across sensors and
  models, comprising of six tasks ranging from comprehending tactile properties to
  enabling physical perception and manipulation planning. In evaluations, we find
  that SSL pre-training for touch representation outperforms task and sensor-specific
  end-to-end training by 95.1% on average over TacBench, and Sparsh (DINO) and Sparsh
  (IJEPA) are the most competitive, indicating the merits of learning in latent space
  for tactile images. Project page: https://sparsh-ssl.github.io'
