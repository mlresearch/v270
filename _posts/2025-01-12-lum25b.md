title: 'Get a Grip: Multi-Finger Grasp Evaluation at Scale Enables Robust Sim-to-Real
  Transfer'
abstract: 'This work explores conditions under which multi-finger grasping algorithms
  can attain robust sim-to-real transfer. While numerous large datasets facilitate
  learning *generative* models for multi-finger grasping at scale, reliable real-world
  dexterous grasping remains challenging, with most methods degrading when deployed
  on hardware. An alternate strategy is to use *discriminative* grasp evaluation models
  for grasp selection and refinement, conditioned on real-world sensor measurements.
  This paradigm has produced state-of-the-art results for vision-based parallel-jaw
  grasping, but remains unproven in the multi-finger setting. In this work, we find
  that existing datasets and methods have been insufficient for training discriminitive
  models for multi-finger grasping. To train grasp evaluators at scale, datasets must
  provide on the order of millions of grasps, including both positive *and negative
  examples*, with corresponding visual data resembling measurements at inference time.
  To that end, we release a new, open-source dataset of 3.5M grasps on 4.3K objects
  annotated with RGB images, point clouds, and trained NeRFs. Leveraging this dataset,
  we train vision-based grasp evaluators that outperform both analytic and generative
  modeling-based baselines on extensive simulated and real-world trials across a diverse
  range of objects. We show via numerous ablations that the key factor for performance
  is indeed the evaluator, and that its quality degrades as the dataset shrinks, demonstrating
  the importance of our new dataset. Project website at: https://sites.google.com/view/get-a-grip-dataset.'
