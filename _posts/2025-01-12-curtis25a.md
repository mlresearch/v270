title: 'Trust the PRoC3S: Solving Long-Horizon Robotics Problems with LLMs and Constraint
  Satisfaction'
abstract: Recent developments in pretrained large language models (LLMs) applied to
  robotics have demonstrated their capacity for sequencing a set of discrete skills
  to achieve open-ended goals in simple robotic tasks. In this paper, we examine the
  topic of LLM planning for a set of *continuously parameterized* skills whose execution
  must avoid violations of a set of kinematic, geometric, and physical constraints.
  We prompt the LLM to output code for a function with open parameters, which, together
  with environmental constraints, can be viewed as a Continuous Constraint Satisfaction
  Problem (CCSP). This CCSP can be solved through sampling or optimization to find
  a skill sequence and continuous parameter settings that achieve the goal while avoiding
  constraint violations. Additionally, we consider cases where the LLM proposes unsatisfiable
  CCSPs, such as those that are kinematically infeasible, dynamically unstable, or
  lead to collisions, and re-prompt the LLM to form a new CCSP accordingly. Experiments
  across simulated and real-world domains demonstrate that our proposed strategy,
  \OursNoSpace, is capable of solving a wide range of complex manipulation tasks with
  realistic constraints much more efficiently and effectively than existing baselines.
