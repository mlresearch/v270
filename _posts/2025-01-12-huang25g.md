title: 'ReKep: Spatio-Temporal Reasoning of Relational Keypoint Constraints for Robotic
  Manipulation'
abstract: Representing robotic manipulation tasks as constraints that associate the
  robot and the environment is a promising way to encode desired robot behaviors.
  However, it remains unclear how to formulate the constraints such that they are
  1) versatile to diverse tasks, 2) free of manual labeling, and 3) optimizable by
  off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time. In this work, we introduce
  Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), a visually-grounded representation for
  constraints in robotic manipulation. Specifically, ReKep are expressed as Python
  functions mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost.
  We demonstrate that by representing a manipulation task as a sequence of Relational
  Keypoint Constraints, we can employ a hierarchical optimization procedure to solve
  for robot actions (represented by a sequence of end-effector poses in SE(3)) with
  a perception-action loop at a real-time frequency. Furthermore, in order to circumvent
  the need for manual specification of ReKep for each new task, we devise an automated
  procedure that leverages large vision models and vision-language models to produce
  ReKep from free-form language instructions and RGB-D observation. We present system
  implementations on a mobile single-arm platform and a stationary dual-arm platform
  that can perform a large variety of manipulation tasks, featuring multi-stage, in-the-wild,
  bimanual, and reactive behaviors, all without task-specific data or environment
  models.
