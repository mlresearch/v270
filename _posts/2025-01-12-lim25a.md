title: 'EquiGraspFlow: SE(3)-Equivariant 6-DoF Grasp Pose Generative Flows'
abstract: Traditional methods for synthesizing 6-DoF grasp poses from 3D observations
  often rely on geometric heuristics, resulting in poor generalizability, limited
  grasp options, and higher failure rates. Recently, data-driven methods have been
  proposed that use generative models to learn the distribution of grasp poses and
  generate diverse candidate poses. The main drawback of these methods is that they
  fail to achieve SE(3)-equivariance, meaning that the generated grasp poses do not
  transform correctly with object rotations and translations. In this paper, we propose
  \textit{EquiGraspFlow}, a flow-based SE(3)-equivariant 6-DoF grasp pose generative
  model that can learn complex conditional distributions on the SE(3) manifold while
  guaranteeing SE(3)-equivariance. Our model achieves the equivariance without relying
  on data augmentation, by using network architectures that guarantee the equivariance
  by construction. Extensive experiments show that \textit{EquiGraspFlow} accurately
  learns grasp pose distribution, achieves the SE(3)-equivariance, and significantly
  outperforms existing grasp pose generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/bdlim99/EquiGraspFlow.
