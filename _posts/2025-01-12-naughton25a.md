title: 'ResPilot: Teleoperated Finger Gaiting via Gaussian Process Residual Learning'
abstract: Dexterous robot hand teleoperation allows for long-range transfer of human
  manipulation expertise, and could simultaneously provide a way for humans to teach
  these skills to robots. However, current methods struggle to reproduce the functional
  workspace of the human hand, often limiting them to simple grasping tasks. We present
  a novel method for finger-gaited manipulation with multi-fingered robot hands. Our
  method provides the operator enhanced flexibility in making contacts by expanding
  the reachable workspace of the robot hand through residual Gaussian Process learning.
  We also assist the operator in maintaining stable contacts with the object by allowing
  them to constrain fingertips of the hand to move in concert. Extensive quantitative
  evaluations show that our method significantly increases the reachable workspace
  of the robot hand and enables the completion of novel dexterous finger gaiting tasks.
