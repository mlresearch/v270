title: 'IMAGINATION POLICY: Using Generative Point Cloud Models for Learning Manipulation
  Policies'
abstract: Humans can imagine goal states during planning and perform actions to match
  those goals. In this work, we propose IMAGINATION POLICY, a novel multi-task key-frame
  policy network for solving high-precision pick and place tasks. Instead of learning
  actions directly, IMAGINATION POLICY generates point clouds to imagine desired states
  which are then translated to actions using rigid action estimation. This transforms
  action inference into a local generative task. We leverage pick and place symmetries
  underlying the tasks in the generation process and achieve extremely high sample
  efficiency and generalizability to unseen configurations. Finally, we demonstrate
  state-of-the-art performance across various tasks on the RLbench benchmark compared
  with several strong baselines and validate our approach on a real robot.
