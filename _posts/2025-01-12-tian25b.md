title: Tokenize the World into Object-level Knowledge to Address Long-tail Events
  in Autonomous Driving
abstract: The autonomous driving industry is increasingly adopting end-to-end learning
  from sensory inputs to minimize human biases in system design. Traditional end-to-end
  driving models, however, suffer from long-tail events due to rare or unseen inputs
  within their training distributions. To address this, we propose TOKEN, a novel
  Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MM-LLM) that tokenizes the world into object-level
  knowledge, enabling better utilization of LLMâ€™s reasoning capabilities to enhance
  autonomous vehicle planning in long-tail scenarios. TOKEN effectively alleviates
  data scarcity and inefficient tokenization by producing condensed and semantically
  enriched representations of the scene. Our results demonstrate that TOKEN excels
  in grounding, reasoning, and planning capabilities, outperforming existing frameworks
  with a 27% reduction in trajectory L2 error and a 39% decrease in collision rates
  in long-tail scenarios. Additionally, our work highlights the importance of representation
  alignment and structured reasoning in sparking the common-sense reasoning capabilities
  of MM-LLMs for effective planning.
