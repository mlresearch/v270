title: 'Policy Adaptation via Language Optimization: Decomposing Tasks for Few-Shot
  Imitation'
abstract: Learned language-conditioned robot policies often struggle to effectively
  adapt to new real-world tasks even when pre-trained across a diverse set of instructions.
  We propose a novel approach for few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks that exploits
  the semantic understanding of task decomposition provided by vision-language models
  (VLMs). Our method, Policy Adaptation via Language Optimization (PALO), combines
  a handful of demonstrations of a task with proposed language decompositions sampled
  from a VLM to quickly enable rapid nonparametric adaptation, avoiding the need for
  a larger fine-tuning dataset. We evaluate PALO on extensive real-world experiments
  consisting of challenging unseen, long-horizon robot manipulation tasks. We find
  that PALO is able of consistently complete long-horizon, multi-tier tasks in the
  real world, outperforming state of the art pre-trained generalist policies, and
  methods that have access to the same demonstrations.
