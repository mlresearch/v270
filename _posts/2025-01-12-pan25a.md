title: 'LiDARGrid: Self-supervised 3D Opacity Grid from LiDAR for Scene Forecasting'
abstract: Timely capturing the dense geometry of the surrounding scene with unlabeled
  LiDAR data is valuable but under-explored for mobile robotic applications. Its value
  lies in the huge amount of such unlabeled data, enabling self-supervised learning
  for various downstream tasks. Current dynamic 3D scene reconstruction approaches
  however heavily rely on data annotations to tackle the moving objects in the scene.
  In response, we present LiDARGrid, a 3D opacity grid representation instantly derived
  from LiDAR points, which captures the dense 3D scene and facilitates scene forecasting.
  Our method features a novel self-supervised neural volume densification procedure
  based on an autoencoder and differentiable volume rendering. Leveraging this representation,
  self-supervised scene forecasting can be performed. Our method is trained on NuScenes
  dataset for autonomous driving, and is evaluated by predicting future point clouds
  using the scene forecasting. It notably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
  point cloud forecasting in all performance metrics. Beyond scene forecasting, our
  representation excels in supporting additional tasks such as moving region detection
  and depth completion, as shown by experiments.
