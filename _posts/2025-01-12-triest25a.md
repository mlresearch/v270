title: 'Velociraptor: Leveraging Visual Foundation Models for Label-Free, Risk-Aware
  Off-Road Navigation'
abstract: Traversability analysis in off-road regimes is a challenging task that requires
  understanding of multi-modal inputs such as camera and LiDAR. These measurements
  are often sparse, noisy, and difficult to interpret, particularly in the off-road
  setting. Existing systems are very engineering-intensive, often requiring hand-tuning
  of traversability rules and manual annotation of semantic labels. Furthermore, existing
  methods for analyzing traversability risk and uncertainty are computationally expensive
  or not well-calibrated. We propose Velociraptor, a traversability analysis system
  that performs [veloci]ty-informed, [r]isk-[a]ware [p]erception and [t]raversability
  for [o]ff-[r]oad driving without any human annotations. We achieve this via the
  use of visual foundation models (VFMs) and geometric mapping to produce a rich visual-geometric
  representation of the robotâ€™s local environment. We then leverage this representation
  to produce costmaps, speedmaps, and uncertainty maps using state-of-the-art fully
  self-supervised techniques. Our approach enables intelligent high-speed off-road
  navigation with zero human annotation, and with about forty minutes of expert data,
  outperforms several geometric and semantic traversability baselines, both in offline
  and real-world robot trials across multiple challenging off-road sites.
