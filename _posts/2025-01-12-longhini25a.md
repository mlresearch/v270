title: 'Cloth-Splatting: 3D Cloth State Estimation from RGB Supervision'
abstract: We introduce Cloth-Splatting, a method for estimating 3D states of cloth
  from RGB images through a prediction-update framework. Cloth-Splatting leverages
  an action-conditioned dynamics model for predicting future states and uses 3D Gaussian
  Splatting to update the predicted states. Our key insight is that coupling a 3D
  mesh-based representation with Gaussian Splatting allows us to define a differentiable
  map between the cloth’s state space and the image space. This enables the use of
  gradient-based optimization techniques to refine inaccurate state estimates using
  only RGB supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that Cloth-Splatting not only
  improves state estimation accuracy over current baselines but also reduces convergence
  time by $\sim 85$ %.
