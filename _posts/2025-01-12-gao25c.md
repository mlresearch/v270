title: Provably Safe Online Multi-Agent Navigation in Unknown Environments
abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide safety guarantees for multi-agent
  navigation. However, traditional approaches require full knowledge of the environment
  (e.g., obstacle positions and shapes) to formulate CBFs and hence, are not applicable
  in unknown environments. This paper overcomes this issue by proposing an Online
  Exploration-based Control Lyapunov Barrier Function (OE-CLBF) controller. It estimates
  the unknown environment by learning its corresponding CBF with a Support Vector
  Machine (SVM) in an online manner, using local neighborhood information, and leverages
  the latter to generate actions for safe navigation. To reduce the computation incurred
  by the online SVM training, we use an Imitation Learning (IL) framework to predict
  the importance of neighboring agents with Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and train
  the SVM only with information received from neighbors of high ‘value’. The OE-CLBF
  allows for decentralized deployment, and importantly, provides provable safety guarantees
  that we derive in this paper. Experiments corroborate theoretical findings and demonstrate
  superior performance w.r.t. state-of-the-art baselines in a variety of unknown environments.
