title: So You Think You Can Scale Up Autonomous Robot Data Collection?
abstract: 'A long-standing goal in robot learning is to develop methods for robots
  to acquire new skills autonomously. While reinforcement learning (RL) comes with
  the promise of enabling autonomous data collection, it remains challenging to scale
  in the real-world partly due to the significant effort required for environment
  design and instrumentation, including the need for designing reset functions or
  accurate success detectors. On the other hand, imitation learning (IL) methods require
  little to no environment design effort, but instead require significant human supervision
  in the form of collected demonstrations. To address these shortcomings, recent works
  in autonomous IL start with an initial seed dataset of human demonstrations that
  an autonomous policy can bootstrap from. While autonomous IL approaches come with
  the promise of addressing the challenges of autonomous RL—environment design challenges—as
  well as the challenges of pure IL strategies—extensive human supervision—in this
  work, we posit that such techniques do not deliver on this promise and are still
  unable to scale up autonomous data collection in the real world. Through a series
  of targeted real-world experiments, we demonstrate that these approaches, when scaled
  up to realistic settings, face much of the same scaling challenges as prior attempts
  in RL in terms of environment design. Further, we perform a rigorous study of various
  autonomous IL methods across different data scales and 7 simulation and real-world
  tasks, and demonstrate that while autonomous data collection can modestly improve
  performance (on the order of 10%), simply collecting more human data often provides
  significantly more improvement. Our work suggests a negative result: that scaling
  up autonomous data collection for learning robot policies for real-world tasks is
  more challenging and impractical than what is suggested in prior work. We hope these
  insights about the core challenges of scaling up data collection help inform future
  efforts in autonomous learning.'
