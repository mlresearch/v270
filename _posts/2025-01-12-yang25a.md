title: 'EquiBot: SIM(3)-Equivariant Diffusion Policy for Generalizable and Data Efficient
  Learning'
abstract: Building effective imitation learning methods that enable robots to learn
  from limited data and still generalize across diverse real-world environments is
  a long-standing problem in robot learning. We propose EquiBot, a robust, data-efficient,
  and generalizable approach for robot manipulation task learning. Our approach combines
  SIM(3)-equivariant neural network architectures with diffusion models. This ensures
  that our learned policies are invariant to changes in scale, rotation, and translation,
  enhancing their applicability to unseen environments while retaining the benefits
  of diffusion-based policy learning such as multi-modality and robustness. We show
  on a suite of 6 simulation tasks that our proposed method reduces the data requirements
  and improves generalization to novel scenarios. In the real world, with 10 variations
  of 6 mobile manipulation tasks, we show that our method can easily generalize to
  novel objects and scenes after learning from just 5 minutes of human demonstrations
  in each task.
