title: 'HumanPlus: Humanoid Shadowing and Imitation from Humans'
abstract: One of the key arguments for building robots that have similar form factors
  to human beings is that we can leverage the massive human data for training.Yet,
  doing so has remained challenging in practice due to the complexities in humanoid
  perception and control, lingering physical gaps between humanoids and humans in
  morphologies and actuation, and lack of a data pipeline for humanoids to learn autonomous
  skills from egocentric vision. In this paper, we introduce a full-stack system for
  humanoids to learn motion and autonomous skills from human data. We first train
  a low-level policy in simulation via reinforcement learning using existing 40-hour
  human motion datasets. This policy transfers to the real world and allows humanoid
  robots to follow human body and hand motion in real time using only a RGB camera,
  i.e. shadowing. Through shadowing, human operators can teleoperate humanoids to
  collect whole-body data for learning different tasks in the real world. Using the
  data collected, we then perform supervised behavior cloning to train skill policies
  using egocentric vision, allowing humanoids to complete different tasks autonomously
  by imitating human skills. We demonstrate the system on our customized 33-DoF 180cm
  humanoid, autonomously completing tasks such as wearing a shoe to stand up and walk,
  folding a sweatshirt, rearranging objects, typing, and greeting another robot with
  60-100% success rates using up to 40 demonstrations.
