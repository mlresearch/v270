title: Adaptive Language-Guided Abstraction from Contrastive Explanations
abstract: Many approaches to robot learning begin by inferring a reward function from
  a set of human demonstrations. To learn a good reward, it is necessary to determine
  which features of the environment are relevant before determining how these features
  should be used to compute reward. In particularly complex, high-dimensional environments,
  human demonstrators often struggle to fully specify their desired behavior from
  a small number of demonstrations. End-to-end reward learning methods (e.g., using
  deep networks or program synthesis techniques) often yield brittle reward functions
  that are sensitive to spurious state features. By contrast, humans can often generalizably
  learn from a small number of demonstrations by incorporating strong priors about
  what features of a demonstration are likely meaningful for a task of interest. How
  do we build robots that leverage this kind of background knowledge when learning
  from new demonstrations? This paper describes a method named ALGAE which alternates
  between using language models to iteratively identify human-meaningful features
  needed to explain demonstrated behavior, then standard inverse reinforcement learning
  techniques to assign weights to these features. Experiments across a variety of
  both simulated and real-world robot environments show that ALGAElearns generalizable
  reward functions defined on interpretable features using only small numbers of demonstrations.
  Importantly, ALGAE can recognize when features are missing, then extract and define
  those features without any human input â€“ making it possible to quickly and efficiently
  acquire rich representations of user behavior.
