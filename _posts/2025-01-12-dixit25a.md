title: 'Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with
  Learning-Based Perception'
abstract: Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to be
  used out of the box for transforming high-dimensional, noisy, and partial observations
  of the world into rich occupancy representations. However, the reliability of these
  models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when
  deployed in environments unseen during training. In this work, we address this challenge
  by rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for
  object detection via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction.
  Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states
  when perceptual outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the
  calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to
  provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We
  evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), with experiments
  in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously
  unseen indoor, static environments. These experiments validate the safety assurances
  for obstacle avoidance provided by PwC and demonstrate up to 40% improvements in
  empirical safety compared to baselines.
