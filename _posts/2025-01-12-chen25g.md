title: 'KOROL: Learning Visualizable Object Feature with Koopman Operator Rollout
  for Manipulation'
abstract: 'Learning dexterous manipulation skills presents significant challenges
  due to complex nonlinear dynamics that underlie the interactions between objects
  and multi-fingered hands. Koopman operators have emerged as a robust method for
  modeling such nonlinear dynamics within a linear framework. However, current methods
  rely on runtime access to ground-truth (GT) object states, making them unsuitable
  for vision-based practical applications. Unlike image-to-action policies that implicitly
  learn visual features for control, we use a dynamics model, specifically the Koopman
  operator, to learn visually interpretable object features critical for robotic manipulation
  within a scene. We construct a Koopman operator using object features predicted
  by a feature extractor and utilize it to auto-regressively advance system states.
  We train the feature extractor to embed scene information into object features,
  thereby enabling the accurate propagation of robot trajectories. We evaluate our
  approach on simulated and real-world robot tasks, with results showing that it outperformed
  the model-based imitation learning NDP by 1.08$\times$ and the image-to-action Diffusion
  Policy by 1.16$\times$. The results suggest that our method maintains task success
  rates with learned features and extends applicability to real-world manipulation
  without GT object states. Project video and code are available at: https://github.com/hychen-naza/KOROL.'
