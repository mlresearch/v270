title: 'Gaitor: Learning a Unified Representation Across Gaits for Real-World Quadruped
  Locomotion'
abstract: The current state-of-the-art in quadruped locomotion is able to produce
  a variety of complex motions. These methods either rely on switching between a discrete
  set of skills or learn a distribution across gaits using complex black-box models.
  Alternatively, we present Gaitor, which learns a disentangled and 2D representation
  across locomotion gaits. This learnt representation forms a planning space for closed-loop
  control delivering continuous gait transitions and perceptive terrain traversal.
  Gaitorâ€™s latent space is readily interpretable and we discover that during gait
  transitions, novel unseen gaits emerge. The latent space is disentangled with respect
  to footswing heights and lengths. This means that these gait characteristics can
  be varied independently in the 2D latent representation. Together with a simple
  terrain encoding and a learnt planner operating in the latent space, Gaitor can
  take motion commands including desired gait type and swing characteristics all while
  reacting to uneven terrain. We evaluate Gaitor in both simulation and the real world
  on the ANYmal C platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work learning
  a unified and interpretable latent space for multiple gaits, resulting in continuous
  blending between different locomotion modes on a real quadruped robot. An overview
  of the methods and results in this paper is found at https://youtu.be/eVFQbRyilCA.
