title: Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning with Imitation for Vision-Based Agile
  Flight
abstract: 'Learning visuomotor policies for agile quadrotor flight presents significant
  difficulties, primarily from inefficient policy exploration caused by high-dimensional
  visual inputs and the need for precise and low-latency control. To address these
  challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines the performance of Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) and the sample efficiency of Imitation Learning (IL) in the task of
  vision-based autonomous drone racing. While RL provides a framework for learning
  high-performance controllers through trial and error, it faces challenges with sample
  efficiency and computational demands due to the high dimensionality of visual inputs.
  Conversely, IL efficiently learns from visual expert demonstrations, but it remains
  limited by the expertâ€™s performance and state distribution. To overcome these limitations,
  our policy learning framework integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework
  contains three phases: training a teacher policy using RL with privileged state
  information, distilling it into a student policy via IL, and adaptive fine-tuning
  via RL. Testing in both simulated and real-world scenarios shows our approach can
  not only learn in scenarios where RL from scratch fails but also outperforms existing
  IL methods in both robustness and performance, successfully navigating a quadrotor
  through a race course using only visual information.'
