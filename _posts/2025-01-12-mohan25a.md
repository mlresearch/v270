title: Progressive Multi-Modal Fusion for Robust 3D Object Detection
abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for accurate 3D object detection in autonomous
  driving, with cameras and LiDAR being the most commonly used sensors. However, existing
  methods perform sensor fusion in a single view by projecting features from both
  modalities either in Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) or Perspective View (PV), thus sacrificing
  complementary information such as height or geometric proportions. To address this
  limitation, we propose ProFusion3D, a progressive fusion framework that combines
  features in both BEV and PV at both intermediate and object query levels. Our architecture
  hierarchically fuses local and global features, enhancing the robustness of 3D object
  detection. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised mask modeling pre-training
  strategy to improve multi-modal representation learning and data efficiency through
  three novel objectives. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets
  conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of ProFusion3D. Moreover, ProFusion3D is robust
  to sensor failure, showing strong performance when only one modality is available.
