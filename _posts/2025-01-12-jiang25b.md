title: 'Harmon: Whole-Body Motion Generation of Humanoid Robots from Language Descriptions'
abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like embodiment, have the potential to
  integrate seamlessly into human environments. Critical to their coexistence and
  cooperation with humans is the ability to understand natural language communications
  and exhibit human-like behaviors. This work focuses on generating diverse whole-body
  motions for humanoid robots from language descriptions. We leverage human motion
  priors from extensive human motion datasets to initialize humanoid motions and employ
  the commonsense reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to edit
  and refine these motions. Our approach demonstrates the capability to produce natural,
  expressive, and text-aligned humanoid motions, validated through both simulated
  and real-world experiments. More videos can be found on our website https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/Harmon/.
