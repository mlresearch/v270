title: Automated Creation of Digital Cousins for Robust Policy Learning
abstract: Training robot policies in the real world can be unsafe, costly, and difficult
  to scale. Simulation serves as an inexpensive and potentially limitless source of
  training data, but suffers from the semantics and physics disparity between simulated
  and real-world environments. These discrepancies can be minimized by training in
  *digital twins*, which serve as virtual replicas of a real scene but are expensive
  to generate and cannot produce cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations,
  we propose the concept of ***digital cousins***, a virtual asset or scene that,
  unlike a *digital twin*, does not explicitly model a real-world counterpart but
  still exhibits similar geometric and semantic affordances. As a result, *digital
  cousins* simultaneously reduce the cost of generating an analogous virtual environment
  while also facilitating better robustness during sim-to-real domain transfer by
  providing a distribution of similar training scenes. Leveraging digital cousins,
  we introduce a novel method for their automated creation, and propose a fully automated
  real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for generating fully interactive scenes and training
  robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot in the original scene. We find that
  digital cousin scenes that preserve geometric and semantic affordances can be produced
  automatically, and can be used to train policies that outperform policies trained
  on digital twins, achieving 90% vs. 25% success rates under zero-shot sim-to-real
  transfer. Additional details are available at https://digital-cousins.github.io/.
