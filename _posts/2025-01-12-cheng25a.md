title: 'NOD-TAMP: Generalizable Long-Horizon Planning with Neural Object Descriptors'
abstract: 'Solving complex manipulation tasks in household and factory settings remains
  challenging due to long-horizon reasoning, fine-grained interactions, and broad
  object and scene diversity. Learning skills from demonstrations can be an effective
  strategy, but such methods often have limited generalizability beyond training data
  and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks. To overcome this, we propose to synergistically
  combine two paradigms: Neural Object Descriptors (NODs) that produce generalizable
  object-centric features and Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) frameworks that chain
  short-horizon skills to solve multi-step tasks. We introduce NOD-TAMP, a TAMP-based
  framework that extracts short manipulation trajectories from a handful of human
  demonstrations, adapts these trajectories using NOD features, and composes them
  to solve broad long-horizon, contact-rich tasks. NOD-TAMP solves existing manipulation
  benchmarks with a handful of demonstrations and significantly outperforms prior
  NOD-based approaches on new tabletop manipulation tasks that require diverse generalization.
  Finally, we deploy NOD-TAMP on a number of real-world tasks, including tool-use
  and high-precision insertion. For more details, please visit https://nodtamp.github.io/.'
