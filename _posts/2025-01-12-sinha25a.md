title: Rate-Informed Discovery via Bayesian Adaptive Multifidelity Sampling
abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires both accurate
  estimation of their performance and efficient discovery of potential failure cases.
  This paper introduces Bayesian adaptive multifidelity sampling (BAMS), which leverages
  the power of adaptive Bayesian sampling to achieve efficient discovery while simultaneously
  estimating the rate of adverse events. BAMS prioritizes exploration of regions with
  potentially low performance, leading to the identification of novel and critical
  scenarios that traditional methods might miss. Using real-world AV data we demonstrate
  that BAMS discovers 10 times as many issues as Monte Carlo (MC) and importance sampling
  (IS) baselines, while at the same time generating rate estimates with variances
  15 and 6 times narrower than MC and IS baselines respectively.
