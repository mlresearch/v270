title: 'DriveVLM: The Convergence of Autonomous Driving and Large Vision-Language
  Models'
abstract: A primary hurdle of autonomous driving in urban environments is understanding
  complex and long-tail scenarios, such as challenging road conditions and delicate
  human behaviors. We introduce DriveVLM, an autonomous driving system leveraging
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for enhanced scene understanding and planning capabilities.
  DriveVLM integrates a unique combination of reasoning modules for scene description,
  scene analysis, and hierarchical planning. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations
  of VLMs in spatial reasoning and heavy computational requirements, we propose DriveVLM-Dual,
  a hybrid system that synergizes the strengths of DriveVLM with the traditional autonomous
  driving pipeline. Experiments on both the nuScenes dataset and our SUP-AD dataset
  demonstrate the efficacy of DriveVLM and DriveVLM-Dual in handling complex and unpredictable
  driving conditions. Finally, we deploy the DriveVLM-Dual on a production vehicle,
  verifying it is effective in real-world autonomous driving environments.
