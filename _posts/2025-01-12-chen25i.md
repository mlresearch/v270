title: 'Online Transfer and Adaptation of Tactile Skill: A Teleoperation Framework'
abstract: This paper presents a teleoperation framework designed for online learning
  and adaptation of tactile skills, which provides an intuitive interface without
  need for physical access to execution robot. The proposed tele-teaching approach
  utilizes periodical Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMP) and Recursive Least Square
  (RLS) for generating tactile skills. An autonomy allocation strategy, guided by
  the learning confidence and operator intention, ensures a smooth transition between
  human demonstration to autonomous robot operation. Our experimental results with
  two 7 Degree of Freedom (DoF) Franka Panda robot demonstrates that the tele-teaching
  framework facilitates online motion and force learning and adaptation within a few
  iterations.
