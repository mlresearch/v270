title: 'Legolas: Deep Leg-Inertial Odometry'
abstract: 'Estimating odometry, where an accumulating position and rotation is tracked,
  has critical applications in many areas of robotics as a form of state estimation
  such as in SLAM, navigation, and controls. During deployment of a legged robot,
  a vision system’s tracking can easily get lost. Instead, using only the onboard
  leg and inertial sensor for odometry is a promising alternative. Previous methods
  in estimating leg-inertial odometry require analytical modeling or collecting high-quality
  real-world trajectories to train a model. Analytical modeling is specific to each
  robot, requires manual fine-tuning, and doesn’t always capture real-world phenomena
  such as slippage. Previous work learning legged odometry still relies on collecting
  real-world data, this has been shown to not perform well out of distribution. In
  this work, we show that it is possible to estimate the odometry of a legged robot
  without any analytical modeling or real-world data collection. In this paper, we
  present Legolas, the first method that accurately estimates odometry in a purely
  data-driven fashion for quadruped robots. We deploy our method on two real-world
  quadruped robots in both indoor and outdoor environments. In the indoor scenes,
  our proposed method accomplishes a relative pose error that is 73% less than an
  analytical filtering-based approach and 87.5% less than a real-world behavioral
  cloning approach. More results are available at: learned-odom.github.io'
