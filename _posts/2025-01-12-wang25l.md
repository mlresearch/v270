title: 'Neural Attention Field: Emerging Point Relevance in 3D Scenes for One-Shot
  Dexterous Grasping'
abstract: One-shot transfer of dexterous grasps to novel scenes with object and context
  variations has been a challenging problem. While distilled feature fields from large
  vision models have enabled semantic correspondences across 3D scenes, their features
  are point-based and restricted to object surfaces, limiting their capability of
  modeling complex semantic feature distributions for hand-object interactions. In
  this work, we propose the *neural attention field* for representing semantic-aware
  dense feature fields in the 3D space by modeling inter-point relevance instead of
  individual point features. Core to it is a transformer decoder that computes the
  cross-attention between any 3D query point with all the scene points, and provides
  the query point feature with an attention-based aggregation. We further propose
  a self-supervised framework for training the transformer decoder from only a few
  3D pointclouds without hand demonstrations. Post-training, the attention field can
  be applied to novel scenes for semantics-aware dexterous grasping from one-shot
  demonstration. Experiments show that our method provides better optimization landscapes
  by encouraging the end-effector to focus on task-relevant scene regions, resulting
  in significant improvements in success rates on real robots compared with the feature-field-based
  methods.
