title: 'ACE: A Cross-platform and visual-Exoskeletons System for Low-Cost Dexterous
  Teleoperation'
abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation with dexterous hands has a large potential
  workability and a wide workspace as it follows the most natural human workflow.
  Learning from human demonstrations has proven highly effective for learning a dexterous
  manipulation policy. To collect such data, teleoperation serves as a straightforward
  and efficient way to do so. However, a cost-effective and easy-to-use teleoperation
  system is lacking for anthropomorphic robot hands. To fill the deficiency, we developed
  \our, a cross-platform visual-exoskeleton system for low-cost dexterous teleoperation.
  Our system employs a hand-facing camera to capture 3D hand poses and an exoskeleton
  mounted on a base that can be easily carried on usersâ€™ backs. ACE captures both
  the hand root end-effector and hand pose in real-time and enables cross-platform
  operations. We evaluate the key system parameters compared with previous teleoperation
  systems and show clear advantages of \our. We then showcase the desktop and mobile
  versions of our system on six different robot platforms (including humanoid-hands,
  arm-hands, arm-gripper, and quadruped-gripper systems), and demonstrate the effectiveness
  of learning three difficult real-world tasks through the collected demonstration
  on two of them.
