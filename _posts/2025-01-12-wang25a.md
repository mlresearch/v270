title: Equivariant Diffusion Policy
abstract: Recent work has shown diffusion models are an effective approach to learning
  the multimodal distributions arising from demonstration data in behavior cloning.
  However, a drawback of this approach is the need to learn a denoising function,
  which is significantly more complex than learning an explicit policy. In this work,
  we propose Equivariant Diffusion Policy, a novel diffusion policy learning method
  that leverages domain symmetries to obtain better sample efficiency and generalization
  in the denoising function. We theoretically analyze the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry
  of full 6-DoF control and characterize when a diffusion model is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant.
  We furthermore evaluate the method empirically on a set of 12 simulation tasks in
  MimicGen, and show that it obtains a success rate that is, on average, 21.9% higher
  than the baseline Diffusion Policy. We also evaluate the method on a real-world
  system to show that effective policies can be learned with relatively few training
  samples, whereas the baseline Diffusion Policy cannot.
