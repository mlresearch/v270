title: 'OCCAM: Online Continuous Controller Adaptation with Meta-Learned Models'
abstract: 'Control tuning and adaptation present a significant challenge to the usage
  of robots in diverse environments. It is often nontrivial to find a single set of
  control parameters by hand that work well across the broad array of environments
  and conditions that a robot might encounter. Automated adaptation approaches must
  utilize prior knowledge about the system while adapting to significant domain shifts
  to find new control parameters quickly. In this work, we present a general framework
  for online controller adaptation that deals with these challenges. We combine meta-learning
  with Bayesian recursive estimation to learn prior predictive models of system performance
  that quickly adapt to online data, even when there is significant domain shift.
  These predictive models can be used as cost functions within efficient sampling-based
  optimization routines to find new control parameters online that maximize system
  performance. Our framework is powerful and flexible enough to adapt controllers
  for four diverse systems: a simulated race car, a simulated quadrupedal robot, and
  a simulated and physical quadrotor.'
