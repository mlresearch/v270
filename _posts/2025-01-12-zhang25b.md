title: 'HiRT: Enhancing Robotic Control with Hierarchical Robot Transformers'
abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre-trained
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due
  to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost.
  Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational
  costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static
  tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To
  address these limitations, this paper proposes \textbf{HiRT}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical
  \textbf{R}obot \textbf{T}ransformer framework that enables flexible frequency and
  performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily
  invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency
  vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in
  both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over
  baseline methods. Empirically, we achieve a 58% reduction in inference time delay
  while maintaining comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel dynamic manipulation
  benchmarks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success
  rate from 48% to 75%.
