title: Enhancing Visual Domain Robustness in Behaviour Cloning via Saliency-Guided
  Augmentation
abstract: In vision-based behaviour cloning (BC), traditional image-level augmentation
  methods such as pixel shifting enhance in-domain performance but often struggle
  with visual domain shifts, including distractors, occlusion, and changes in lighting
  and backgrounds. Conversely, superimposition-based augmentation, proven effective
  in computer vision, improves model generalisability by blending training images
  and out-of-domain images. Despite its potential, the applicability of these methods
  to vision-based BC remains unclear due to the unique challenges posed by BC demonstrations;
  specifically, preserving task-critical scene semantics, spatial-temporal relationships,
  and agent-target interactions is crucial. To address this, we introduce RoboSaGA,
  a context-aware approach that dynamically adjusts augmentation intensity per pixel
  based on input saliency derived from the policy. This method ensures aggressive
  augmentation within task-trivial areas without compromising task-critical information.
  Furthermore, RoboSaGA seamlessly integrates into existing network architectures
  without the need for structural changes or additional learning objectives. Our empirical
  evaluations across both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that RoboSaGA
  not only maintains in-domain performance but significantly improves resilience to
  distractors and background variations.
