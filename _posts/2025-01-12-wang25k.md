title: 'ViPER: Visibility-based Pursuit-Evasion via Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: In visibility-based pursuit-evasion tasks, a team of mobile pursuer robots
  with limited sensing capabilities is tasked with detecting all evaders in a multiply-connected
  planar environment, whose map may or may not be known to pursuers beforehand. This
  requires tight coordination among multiple agents to ensure that the omniscient
  and potentially arbitrarily fast evaders are guaranteed to be detected by the pursuers.
  Whereas existing methods typically rely on a relatively large team of agents to
  clear the environment, we propose ViPER, a neural solution that leverages a graph
  attention network to learn a coordinated yet distributed policy via multi-agent
  reinforcement learning (MARL). We experimentally demonstrate that ViPER significantly
  outperforms other state-of-the-art non-learning planners, showcasing its emergent
  coordinated behaviors and adaptability to more challenging scenarios and various
  team sizes, and finally deploy its learned policies on hardware in an aerial search
  task.
