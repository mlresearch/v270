title: Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions with Symbolic Derivative Bounds
  Propagation
abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are important in safety-critical systems
  and robot control applications. Neural networks have been used to parameterize and
  synthesize CBFs with bounded control input for complex systems. However, it is still
  challenging to verify pre-trained neural networks CBFs (neural CBFs) in an efficient
  symbolic manner. To this end, we propose a new efficient verification framework
  for ReLU-based neural CBFs through symbolic derivative bound propagation by combining
  the linearly bounded nonlinear dynamic system and the gradient bounds of neural
  CBFs. Specifically, with Heaviside step function form for derivatives of activation
  functions, we show that the symbolic bounds can be propagated through the inner
  product of neural CBF Jacobian and nonlinear system dynamics. Through extensive
  experiments on different robot dynamics, our results outperform the interval arithmetic-based
  baselines in verified rate and verification time along the CBF boundary, validating
  the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method with different model complexity.
