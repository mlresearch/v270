title: 'Sparse Diffusion Policy: A Sparse, Reusable, and Flexible Policy for Robot
  Learning'
abstract: The increasing complexity of tasks in robotics demands efficient strategies
  for multitask and continual learning. Traditional models typically rely on a universal
  policy for all tasks, facing challenges such as high computational costs and catastrophic
  forgetting when learning new tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a sparse,
  reusable, and flexible policy, Sparse Diffusion Policy (SDP). By adopting Mixture
  of Experts (MoE) within a transformer-based diffusion policy, SDP selectively activates
  experts and skills, enabling task-specific learning without retraining the entire
  model. It not only reduces the burden of active parameters but also facilitates
  the seamless integration and reuse of experts across various tasks. Extensive experiments
  on diverse tasks in both simulators and the real world show that SDP 1) excels in
  multitask scenarios with negligible increases in active parameters, 2) prevents
  forgetting in continual learning new tasks, and 3) enables efficient task transfer,
  offering a promising solution for advanced robotic applications. More demos and
  codes can be found on our https://anonymous.4open.science/w/sparse_diffusion_policy-24E7/.
