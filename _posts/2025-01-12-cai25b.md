title: Non-rigid Relative Placement through 3D Dense Diffusion
abstract: The task of “relative placement” is to predict the placement of one object
  in relation to another, e.g. placing a mug on a mug rack. Recent methods for relative
  placement have made tremendous progress towards data-efficient learning for robot
  manipulation; using explicit object-centric geometric reasoning, these approaches
  enable generalization to unseen task variations from a small number of demonstrations.
  State-of-the-art works in this area, however, have yet to represent deformable transformations,
  despite the ubiquity of non-rigid bodies in real world settings. As a first step
  towards bridging this gap, we propose “cross-displacement” - an extension of the
  principles of relative placement to geometric relationships between deformable objects
  - and present a novel vision-based method to learn cross-displacement for a non-rigid
  task through dense diffusion. To this end, we demonstrate our method’s ability to
  generalize to unseen object instances, out-of-distribution scene configurations,
  and multimodal goals on a highly deformable cloth-hanging task beyond the scope
  of prior works.
