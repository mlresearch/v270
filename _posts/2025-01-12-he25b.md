title: 'OmniH2O: Universal and Dexterous Human-to-Humanoid Whole-Body Teleoperation
  and Learning'
abstract: We present OmniH2O (Omni Human-to-Humanoid), a learning-based system for
  whole-body humanoid teleoperation and autonomy. Using kinematic pose as a universal
  control interface, OmniH2O enables various ways for a human to control a full-sized
  humanoid with dexterous hands, including using real-time teleoperation through VR
  headset, verbal instruction, and RGB camera. OmniH2O also enables full autonomy
  by learning from teleoperated demonstrations or integrating with frontier models
  such as GPT-4. OmniH2O demonstrates versatility and dexterity in various real-world
  whole-body tasks through teleoperation or autonomy, such as playing multiple sports,
  moving and manipulating objects, and interacting with humans. We develop an RL-based
  sim-to-real pipeline, which involves large-scale retargeting and augmentation of
  human motion datasets, learning a real-world deployable policy with sparse sensor
  input by imitating a privileged teacher policy, and reward designs to enhance robustness
  and stability. We release the first humanoid whole-body control dataset, OmniH2O-6,
  containing six everyday tasks, and demonstrate humanoid whole-body skill learning
  from teleoperated datasets. Videos at the anonymous website [https://anonymous-omni-h2o.github.io/](https://anonymous-omni-h2o.github.io/)
