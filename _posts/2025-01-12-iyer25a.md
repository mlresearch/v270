title: 'OPEN TEACH: A Versatile Teleoperation System for Robotic Manipulation'
abstract: Open-sourced, user-friendly tools form the bedrock of scientific advancement
  across disciplines. The widespread adoption of data-driven learning has led to remarkable
  progress in multi-fingered dexterity, bimanual manipulation, and applications ranging
  from logistics to home robotics. However, existing data collection platforms are
  often proprietary, costly, or tailored to specific robotic morphologies. We present
  OPEN TEACH, a new teleoperation system leveraging VR headsets to immerse users in
  mixed reality for intuitive robot control. built on the affordable Meta Quest 3,
  which costs $500, OPEN TEACH enables real-time control of various robots, including
  multi-fingered hands, bimanual arms, and mobile manipulators, through an easy-to-use
  app. Using natural hand gestures and movements, users can manipulate robots at up
  to 90Hz with smooth visual feedback and interface widgets offering closeup environment
  views. We demonstrate the versatility of OPEN TEACH across 38 tasks on different
  robots. A comprehensive user study indicates significant improvement in teleoperation
  capability over the AnyTeleop framework. Further experiments exhibit that the collected
  data is compatible with policy learning on 10 dexterous and contact-rich manipulation
  tasks. Currently supporting Franka, xArm, Jaco, Allegro, and Hello Stretch platforms,
  OPEN TEACH is fully open-sourced to promote broader adoption. Videos are available
