title: 'RiEMann: Near Real-Time SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Manipulation without Point
  Cloud Segmentation'
abstract: We present RiEMann, an end-to-end near Real-time SE(3)-Equivariant Robot
  Manipulation imitation learning framework from scene point cloud input. Compared
  to previous methods that rely on descriptor field matching, RiEMann directly predicts
  the target actions for manipulation without any object segmentation. RiEMann can
  efficiently train the visuomotor policy from scratch with 5 to 10 demonstrations
  for a manipulation task, generalizes to unseen SE(3) transformations and instances
  of target objects, resists visual interference of distracting objects, and follows
  the near real-time pose change of the target object. The scalable SE(3)-equivariant
  action space of RiEMann supports both pick-and-place tasks and articulated object
  manipulation tasks. In simulation and real-world 6-DOF robot manipulation experiments,
  we test RiEMann on 5 categories of manipulation tasks with a total of 25 variants
  and show that RiEMann outperforms baselines in both task success rates and SE(3)
  geodesic distance errors (reduced by 68.6%), and achieves 5.4 frames per second
  (fps) network inference speed.
