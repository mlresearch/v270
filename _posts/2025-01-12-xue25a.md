title: Robust Manipulation Primitive Learning via Domain Contraction
abstract: 'Contact-rich manipulation plays an important role in everyday life, but
  uncertain parameters pose significant challenges to model-based planning and control.
  To address this issue, domain adaptation and domain randomization have been proposed
  to learn robust policies. However, they either lose the generalization ability to
  diverse instances or perform conservatively due to neglecting instance-specific
  information. In this paper, we propose a bi-level approach to learn robust manipulation
  primitives, including parameter-augmented policy learning using multiple models
  with tensor approximation, and parameter-conditioned policy retrieval through domain
  contraction. This approach unifies domain randomization and domain adaptation, providing
  optimal behaviors while keeping generalization ability. We validate the proposed
  method on three contact-rich manipulation primitives: hitting, pushing, and reorientation.
  The experimental results showcase the superior performance of our approach in generating
  robust policies for instances with diverse physical parameters.'
