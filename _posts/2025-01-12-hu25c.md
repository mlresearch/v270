title: Learning Granular Media Avalanche Behavior for Indirectly Manipulating Obstacles
  on a Granular Slope
abstract: Legged robot locomotion on sand slopes is challenging due to the complex
  dynamics of granular media and how the lack of solid surfaces can hinder locomotion.
  A promising strategy, inspired by ghost crabs and other organisms in nature, is
  to strategically interact with rocks, debris, and other obstacles to facilitate
  movement. To provide legged robots with this ability, we present a novel approach
  that leverages avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on a granular
  slope. We use a Vision Transformer (ViT) to process image representations of granular
  dynamics and robot excavation actions. The ViT predicts object movement, which we
  use to determine which leg excavation action to execute. We collect training data
  from 100 real physical trials and, at test time, deploy our trained model in novel
  settings. Experimental results suggest that our model can accurately predict object
  movements and achieve a success rate $\geq$ 80% in a variety of manipulation tasks
  with up to four obstacles, and can also generalize to objects with different physics
  properties. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to leverage granular media
  avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on granular slopes. Supplementary
