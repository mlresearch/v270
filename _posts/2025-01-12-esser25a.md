title: Action Space Design in Reinforcement Learning for Robot Motor Skills
abstract: Practitioners often rely on intuition to select action spaces for learning.
  The choice can substantially impact final performance even when choosing among configuration-space
  representations such as joint position, velocity, and torque commands. We examine
  action space selection considering a wheeled-legged robot, a quadruped robot, and
  a simulated suite of locomotion, manipulation, and control tasks. We analyze the
  mechanisms by which action space can improve performance and conclude that the action
  space can influence learning performance substantially in a task-dependent way.
  Moreover, we find that much of the practical impact of action space selection on
  learning dynamics can be explained by improved policy initialization and behavior
  between timesteps.
