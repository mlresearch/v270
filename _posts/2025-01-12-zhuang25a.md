title: Humanoid Parkour Learning
abstract: Parkour is a grand challenge for legged locomotion, even for quadruped robots,
  requiring active perception and various maneuvers to overcome multiple challenging
  obstacles. Existing methods for humanoid locomotion either optimize a trajectory
  for a single parkour track or train a reinforcement learning policy only to walk
  with a significant amount of motion references. In this work, we propose a framework
  for learning an end-to-end vision-based whole-body-control parkour policy for humanoid
  robots that overcomes multiple parkour skills without any motion prior. Using the
  parkour policy, the humanoid robot can jump on a 0.42m platform, leap over hurdles,
  0.8m gaps, and much more. It can also run at 1.8m/s in the wild and walk robustly
  on different terrains. We test our policy in indoor and outdoor environments to
  demonstrate that it can autonomously select parkour skills while following the rotation
  command of the joystick. We override the arm actions and show that this framework
  can easily transfer to humanoid mobile manipulation tasks. Videos can be found at
