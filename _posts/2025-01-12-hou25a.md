title: 'TaMMa: Target-driven Multi-subscene Mobile Manipulation'
abstract: For everyday service robotics, the ability to navigate back and forth based
  on tasks in multi-subscene environments and perform delicate manipulations is crucial
  and highly practical. While existing robotics primarily focus on complex tasks within
  a single scene or simple tasks across scalable scenes individually, robots consisting
  of a mobile base with a robotic arm face the challenge of efficiently representing
  multiple subscenes, coordinating the collaboration between the mobile base and the
  robotic arm, and managing delicate tasks in scalable environments. To address this
  issue, we propose Target-driven Multi-subscene Mobile Manipulation (\textit{TaMMa}),
  which efficiently handles mobile base movement and fine-grained manipulation across
  subscenes. Specifically, we obtain a reliable 3D Gaussian initialization of the
  whole scene using a sparse 3D point cloud with encoded semantics. Through querying
  the coarse Gaussians, we acquire the approximate pose of the target, navigate the
  mobile base to approach it, and reduce the scope of precise target pose estimation
  to the corresponding subscene. Optimizing while moving, we employ diffusion-based
  depth completion to optimize fine-grained Gaussians and estimate the targetâ€™s refined
  pose. For target-driven manipulation, we adopt Gaussians inpainting to obtain precise
  poses for the origin and destination of the operation in a \textit{think before
  you do it} manner, enabling fine-grained manipulation. We conduct various experiments
  on a real robotic to demonstrate our method in effectively and efficiently achieving
  precise operation tasks across multiple tabletop subscenes.
