title: 'Event3DGS: Event-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Speed Robot Egomotion'
abstract: 'By combining differentiable rendering with explicit point-based scene representations,
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated breakthrough 3D reconstruction capabilities.
  However, to date 3DGS has had limited impact on robotics, where high-speed egomotion
  is pervasive: Egomotion introduces motion blur and leads to artifacts in existing
  frame-based 3DGS reconstruction methods. To address this challenge, we introduce
  Event3DGS, an event-based 3DGS framework. By exploiting the exceptional temporal
  resolution of event cameras, Event3GDS can reconstruct high-fidelity 3D structure
  and appearance under high-speed egomotion. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Event3DGS compared with existing
  event-based dense 3D scene reconstruction frameworks; Event3DGS substantially improves
  reconstruction quality (+3dB) while reducing computational costs by 95%. Our framework
  also allows one to incorporate a few motion-blurred frame-based measurements into
  the reconstruction process to further improve appearance fidelity without loss of
  structural accuracy.'
