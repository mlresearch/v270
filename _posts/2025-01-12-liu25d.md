title: Learning Compositional Behaviors from Demonstration and Language
abstract: We introduce Behavior from Language and Demonstration (BLADE), a framework
  for long-horizon robotic manipulation by integrating imitation learning and model-based
  planning. BLADE leverages language-annotated demonstrations, extracts abstract action
  knowledge from large language models (LLMs), and constructs a library of structured,
  high-level action representations. These representations include preconditions and
  effects grounded in visual perception for each high-level action, along with corresponding
  controllers implemented as neural network-based policies. BLADE can recover such
  structured representations automatically, without manually labeled states or symbolic
  definitions. BLADE shows significant capabilities in generalizing to novel situations,
  including novel initial states, external state perturbations, and novel goals. We
  validate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation and on real robots
  with a diverse set of objects with articulated parts, partial observability, and
  geometric constraints.
