title: Dynamic 3D Gaussian Tracking for Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Modeling
abstract: Videos of robots interacting with objects encode rich information about
  the objects’ dynamics. However, existing video prediction approaches typically do
  not explicitly account for the 3D information from videos, such as robot actions
  and objects’ 3D states, limiting their use in real-world robotic applications. In
  this work, we introduce a framework to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view
  RGB videos by explicitly considering the robot’s action trajectories and their effects
  on scene dynamics. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting
  (3DGS) to train a particle-based dynamics model using Graph Neural Networks. This
  model operates on sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked
  3D Gaussian reconstructions. By learning the neural dynamics model on offline robot
  interaction data, our method can predict object motions under varying initial configurations
  and unseen robot actions. The 3D transformations of Gaussians can be interpolated
  from the motions of control particles, enabling the rendering of predicted future
  object states and achieving action-conditioned video prediction. The dynamics model
  can also be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks.
  We conduct experiments on various kinds of deformable materials, including ropes,
  clothes, and stuffed animals, demonstrating our framework’s ability to model complex
  shapes and dynamics. Our project page is available at \url{https://gaussian-gbnd.github.io/}.
