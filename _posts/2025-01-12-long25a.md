title: Learning H-Infinity Locomotion Control
abstract: Stable locomotion in precipitous environments is an essential task for quadruped
  robots, requiring the ability to resist various external disturbances. Recent neural
  policies enhance robustness against disturbances by learning to resist external
  forces sampled from a fixed distribution in the simulated environment. However,
  the force generation process doesn’t consider the robot’s current state, making
  it difficult to identify the most effective direction and magnitude that can push
  the robot to the most unstable but recoverable state. Thus, challenging cases in
  the buffer are insufficient to optimize robustness. In this paper, we propose to
  model the robust locomotion learning process as an adversarial interaction between
  the locomotion policy and a learnable disturbance that is conditioned on the robot
  state to generate appropriate external forces. To make the joint optimization stable,
  our novel $H_{\infty}$ constraint mandates the bound of the ratio between the cost
  and the intensity of the external forces. We verify the robustness of our approach
  in both simulated environments and real-world deployment, on quadrupedal locomotion
  tasks and a more challenging task where the quadruped performs locomotion merely
  on hind legs. Training and deployment code will be made public.
