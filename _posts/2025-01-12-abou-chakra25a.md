title: 'Physically Embodied Gaussian Splatting: A Visually Learnt and Physically Grounded
  3D Representation for Robotics'
abstract: For robots to robustly understand and interact with the physical world,
  it is highly beneficial to have a comprehensive representation – modelling geometry,
  physics, and visual observations – that informs perception, planning, and control
  algorithms. We propose a novel dual “Gaussian-Particle” representation that models
  the physical world while (i) enabling predictive simulation of future states and
  (ii) allowing online correction from visual observations in a dynamic world. Our
  representation comprises particles that capture the geometrical aspect of objects
  in the world and can be used alongside a particle-based physics system to anticipate
  physically plausible future states. Attached to these particles are 3D Gaussians
  that render images from any viewpoint through a splatting process thus capturing
  the visual state. By comparing the predicted and observed images, our approach generates
  “visual forces” that correct the particle positions while respecting known physical
  constraints. By integrating predictive physical modeling with continuous visually-derived
  corrections, our unified representation reasons about the present and future while
  synchronizing with reality. We validate our approach on 2D and 3D tracking tasks
  as well as photometric reconstruction quality. Videos are found at https://embodied-gaussians.github.io/
