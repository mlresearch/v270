title: 'RoVi-Aug: Robot and Viewpoint Augmentation for Cross-Embodiment Robot Learning'
abstract: Scaling up robot learning requires large and diverse datasets, and how to
  efficiently reuse collected data and transfer policies to new embodiments remains
  an open question. Emerging research such as the Open-X Embodiment (OXE) project
  has shown promise in leveraging skills by combining datasets including different
  robots. However, imbalances in the distribution of robot types and camera angles
  in many datasets make policies prone to overfit. To mitigate this issue, we propose
  RoVi-Aug, which leverages state-of-the-art image-to-image generative models to augment
  robot data by synthesizing demonstrations with different robots and camera views.
  Through extensive physical experiments, we show that, by training on robot- and
  viewpoint-augmented data, RoVi-Aug can zero-shot deploy on an unseen robot with
  significantly different camera angles. Compared to test-time adaptation algorithms
  such as Mirage, RoVi-Aug requires no extra processing at test time, does not assume
  known camera angles, and allows policy fine-tuning. Moreover, by co-training on
  both the original and augmented robot datasets, RoVi-Aug can learn multi-robot and
  multi-task policies, enabling more efficient transfer between robots and skills
  and improving success rates by up to 30%.
