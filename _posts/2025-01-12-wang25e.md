title: 'APRICOT: Active Preference Learning and Constraint-Aware Task Planning with
  LLMs'
abstract: Home robots performing personalized tasks must adeptly balance user preferences
  with environmental affordances. We focus on organization tasks within constrained
  spaces, such as arranging items into a refrigerator, where preferences for placement
  collide with physical limitations. The robot must infer user preferences based on
  a small set of demonstrations, which is easier for users to provide than extensively
  defining all their requirements. While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs)
  to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges.
  First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences
  can often explain a single observed behavior. Second, not all user preferences are
  practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment. To address
  these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian
  active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning. APRICOT refines
  its generated preferences by actively querying the user and dynamically adapts its
  plan to respect environmental constraints. We evaluate APRICOT on a dataset of diverse
  organization tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showing
  significant improvements in both preference satisfaction and plan feasibility.
