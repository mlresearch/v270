title: 'TLDR: Unsupervised Goal-Conditioned RL via Temporal Distance-Aware Representations'
abstract: Unsupervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising
  paradigm for developing diverse robotic skills without external supervision. However,
  existing unsupervised GCRL methods often struggle to cover a wide range of states
  in complex environments due to their limited exploration and sparse or noisy rewards
  for GCRL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised GCRL method
  that leverages TemporaL Distance-aware Representations (TLDR). Based on temporal
  distance, TLDR selects faraway goals to initiate exploration and computes intrinsic
  exploration rewards and goal-reaching rewards. Specifically, our exploration policy
  seeks states with large temporal distances (i.e. covering a large state space),
  while the goal-conditioned policy learns to minimize the temporal distance to the
  goal (i.e. reaching the goal). Our results in six simulated locomotion environments
  demonstrate that TLDR significantly outperforms prior unsupervised GCRL methods
  in achieving a wide range of states.
