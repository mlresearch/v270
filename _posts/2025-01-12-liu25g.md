title: Multi-Task Interactive Robot Fleet Learning with Visual World Models
abstract: 'Recent advancements in large-scale multi-task robot learning offer the
  potential for deploying robot fleets in household and industrial settings, enabling
  them to perform diverse tasks across various environments. However, AI-enabled robots
  often face challenges with generalization and robustness when exposed to real-world
  variability and uncertainty. We introduce Sirius-Fleet, a multi-task interactive
  robot fleet learning framework to address these challenges. Sirius-Fleet monitors
  robot performance during deployment and involves humans to correct the robot’s actions
  when necessary. We employ a visual world model to predict the outcomes of future
  actions and build anomaly predictors to predict whether they will likely result
  in anomalies. As the robot autonomy improves, the anomaly predictors automatically
  adapt their prediction criteria, leading to fewer requests for human intervention
  and gradually reducing human workload over time. Evaluations on large-scale benchmarks
  demonstrate Sirius-Fleet’s effectiveness in improving multi-task policy performance
  and monitoring accuracy. We demonstrate Sirius-Fleet’s performance in both RoboCasa
  in simulation and Mutex in the real world, two diverse, large-scale multi-task benchmarks.
