title: Guided Reinforcement Learning for Robust Multi-Contact Loco-Manipulation
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable proficiency in developing
  robust control policies for contact-rich applications. However, it typically requires
  meticulous Markov Decision Process (MDP) designing tailored to each task and robotic
  platform. This work addresses this challenge by creating a systematic approach to
  behavior synthesis and control for multi-contact loco-manipulation. We define a
  task-independent MDP formulation to learn robust RL policies using a single demonstration
  (per task) generated from a fast model-based trajectory optimization method. Our
  framework is validated on diverse real-world tasks, such as navigating spring-loaded
  doors and manipulating heavy dishwashers. The learned behaviors can handle dynamic
  uncertainties and external disturbances, showcasing recovery maneuvers, such as
  re-grasping objects during execution. Finally, we successfully transfer the policies
  to a real robot, demonstrating the approachâ€™s practical viability.
