title: Sim-to-Real Transfer via 3D Feature Fields for Vision-and-Language Navigation
abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) enables the agent to navigate to a
  remote location in 3D environments following the natural language instruction. In
  this field, the agent is usually trained and evaluated in the navigation simulators,
  lacking effective approaches for sim-to-real transfer. The VLN agents with only
  a monocular camera exhibit extremely limited performance, while the mainstream VLN
  models trained with panoramic observation, perform better but are difficult to deploy
  on most monocular robots. For this case, we propose a sim-to-real transfer approach
  to endow the monocular robots with panoramic traversability perception and panoramic
  semantic understanding, thus smoothly transferring the high-performance panoramic
  VLN models to the common monocular robots. In this work, the semantic traversable
  map is proposed to predict agent-centric navigable waypoints, and the novel view
  representations of these navigable waypoints are predicted through the 3D feature
  fields. These methods broaden the limited field of view of the monocular robots
  and significantly improve navigation performance in the real world. Our VLN system
  outperforms previous SOTA monocular VLN methods in R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks
  within the simulation environments and is also validated in real-world environments,
  providing a practical and high-performance solution for real-world VLN.
