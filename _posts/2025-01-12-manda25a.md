title: Learning Performance-oriented Control Barrier Functions Under Complex Safety
  Constraints and Limited Actuation
abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer an elegant framework for constraining
  nonlinear control system dynamics to an invariant subset of a pre-specified safe
  set. However, finding a CBF that simultaneously promotes performance by maximizing
  the resulting control invariant set while accommodating complex safety constraints,
  especially in high relative degree systems with actuation constraints, remains a
  significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised learning
  framework that holistically addresses these hurdles. Given a Boolean composition
  of multiple state constraints defining the safe set, our approach begins by constructing
  a smooth function whose zero superlevel set provides an inner approximation of the
  safe set. This function is then used with a smooth neural network to parameterize
  the CBF candidate. Finally, we design a physics-informed training loss function
  based on a Hamilton-Jacobi Partial Differential Equation (PDE) to train the PINN-CBF
  and enlarge the volume of the induced control invariant set. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our approach on a 2D double integrator (DI) system and a 7D fixed-wing
  aircraft system (F16).
