title: 'GenSim2: Scaling Robot Data Generation with Multi-modal and Reasoning LLMs'
abstract: Robotic simulation today remains challenging to scale up due to the human
  efforts required to create diverse simulation tasks and scenes. Simulation-trained
  policies also face scalability issues as many sim-to-real methods focus on a single
  task. To address these challenges, this work proposes GenSim2, a scalable framework
  that leverages coding LLMs with multi-modal and reasoning capabilities for complex
  and realistic simulation task creation, including long-horizon tasks with articulated
  objects. To automatically generate demonstration data for these tasks at scale,
  we propose planning and RL solvers that generalize within object categories. The
  pipeline can generate data for up to 100 articulated tasks with 200 objects and
  reduce the required human efforts. To utilize such data, we propose an effective
  multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture, dubbed proprioceptive point-cloud
  transformer (PPT), that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong
  sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. Combining the proposed pipeline and the policy architecture,
  we show a promising usage of GenSim2 that the generated data can be used for zero-shot
  transfer or co-train with real-world collected data, which enhances the policy performance
  by 20% compared with training exclusively on limited real data.
