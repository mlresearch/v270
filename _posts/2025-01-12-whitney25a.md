title: Modeling the Real World with High-Density Visual Particle Dynamics
abstract: We present High-Density Visual Particle Dynamics (HD-VPD), a learned world
  model that can emulate the physical dynamics of real scenes by processing massive
  latent point clouds containing 100K+ particles. To enable efficiency at this scale,
  we introduce a novel family of Point Cloud Transformers (PCTs) called Interlacers
  leveraging intertwined linear-attention Performer layers and graph-based neighbour
  attention layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of HD-VPD by modeling the dynamics
  of high degree-of-freedom bi-manual robots with two RGB-D cameras. Compared to the
  previous graph neural network approach, our Interlacer dynamics is twice as fast
  with the same prediction quality, and can achieve higher quality using 4x as many
  particles. We illustrate how HD-VPD can evaluate motion plan quality with robotic
  box pushing and can grasping tasks. See videos and particle dynamics rendered by
