title: Distribution Discrepancy and Feature Heterogeneity for Active 3D Object Detection
abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical technology for the development
  of autonomous driving and robotics. However, the high cost of data annotation limits
  its advancement. We propose a novel and effective active learning (AL) method called
  Distribution Discrepancy and Feature Heterogeneity (DDFH), which simultaneously
  considers geometric features and model embeddings, assessing information from both
  the instance-level and frame-level perspectives. Distribution Discrepancy evaluates
  the difference and novelty of instances within the unlabeled and labeled distributions,
  enabling the model to learn efficiently with limited data. Feature Heterogeneity
  ensures the heterogeneity of intra-frame instance features, maintaining feature
  diversity while avoiding redundant or similar instances, thus minimizing annotation
  costs. Finally, multiple indicators are efficiently aggregated using Quantile Transform,
  providing a unified measure of informativeness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that DDFH outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the KITTI and
  Waymo datasets, effectively reducing the bounding box annotation cost by 56.3% and
  showing robustness when working with both one-stage and two-stage models.
