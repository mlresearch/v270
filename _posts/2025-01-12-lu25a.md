title: 'KOI: Accelerating Online Imitation Learning via Hybrid Key-state Guidance'
abstract: Online Imitation Learning methods struggle with the gap between extensive
  online exploration space and limited expert trajectories, which hinder efficient
  exploration due to inaccurate task-aware reward estimation. Inspired by the findings
  from cognitive neuroscience that task decomposition could facilitate cognitive processing
  for efficient learning, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise task-aware
  imitation rewards for efficient online exploration by decomposing the target task
  into the objectives of “what to do” and the mechanisms of “how to do”. In this work,
  we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning approach,
  which leverages the integration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for
  task-aware reward estimation. Initially, we utilize the visual-language models to
  segment the expert trajectory into semantic key states, indicating the objectives
  of “what to do”. Within the intervals between semantic key states, optical flow
  is employed to capture motion key states to understand the process of “how to do”.
  By integrating a thorough grasp of both semantic and motion key states, we refine
  the trajectory-matching reward computation, encouraging task-aware exploration for
  efficient online imitation learning. Our experiment results prove that our method
  is more sample efficient than previous state-of-the-art approaches in the Meta-World
  and LIBERO environments. We also conduct real-world robotic manipulation experiments
  to validate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the practical applicability
  of our KOI method.
