title: 'Fleet Supervisor Allocation: A Submodular Maximization Approach'
abstract: In real-world scenarios, the data collected by robots in diverse and unpredictable
  environments is crucial for enhancing their perception and decision-making models.
  This data is predominantly collected under human supervision, particularly through
  imitation learning (IL), where robots learn complex tasks by observing human supervisors.
  However, the deployment of multiple robots and supervisors to accelerate the learning
  process often leads to data redundancy and inefficiencies, especially as the scale
  of robot fleets increases. Moreover, the reliance on teleoperation for supervision
  introduces additional challenges due to potential network connectivity issues. To
  address these issues in data collection, we introduce an Adaptive Submodular Allocation
  policy, ASA, designed for efficient human supervision allocation within multi-robot
  systems under uncertain connectivity conditions. Our approach reduces data redundancy
  by balancing the informativeness and diversity of data collection, and is capable
  of accommodating connectivity variances. We evaluate the effectiveness of ASA in
  simulations with 100 robots across four different environments and various network
  settings, including a real-world teleoperation scenario over a 5G network. We train
  and test our policy, ASA, and state-of-the-art policies utilizing NVIDIAâ€™s Isaac
  Gym. Our results show that ASA enhances the return on human effort by up to $3.37\times$,
  outperforming current baselines in all simulated scenarios and providing robustness
  against connectivity disruptions.
