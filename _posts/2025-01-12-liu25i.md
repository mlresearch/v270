title: 'VoxAct-B: Voxel-Based Acting and Stabilizing Policy for Bimanual Manipulation'
abstract: Bimanual manipulation is critical to many robotics applications. In contrast
  to single-arm manipulation, bimanual manipulation tasks are challenging due to higher-dimensional
  action spaces. Prior works leverage large amounts of data and primitive actions
  to address this problem, but may suffer from sample inefficiency and limited generalization
  across various tasks. To this end, we propose VoxAct-B, a language-conditioned,
  voxel-based method that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to prioritize key
  regions within the scene and reconstruct a voxel grid. We provide this voxel grid
  to our bimanual manipulation policy to learn acting and stabilizing actions. This
  approach enables more efficient policy learning from voxels and is generalizable
  to different tasks. In simulation, we show that VoxAct-B outperforms strong baselines
  on fine-grained bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate VoxAct-B
  on real-world $\texttt{Open Drawer}$ and $\texttt{Open Jar}$ tasks using two UR5s.
