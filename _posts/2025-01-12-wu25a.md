title: 'TidyBot++: An Open-Source Holonomic Mobile Manipulator for Robot Learning'
abstract: Exploiting the promise of recent advances in imitation learning for mobile
  manipulation will require the collection of large numbers of human-guided demonstrations.
  This paper proposes an open-source design for an inexpensive, robust, and flexible
  mobile manipulator that can support arbitrary arms, enabling a wide range of real-world
  household mobile manipulation tasks. Crucially, our design uses powered casters
  to enable the mobile base to be fully holonomic, able to control all planar degrees
  of freedom independently and simultaneously. This feature makes the base more maneuverable
  and simplifies many mobile manipulation tasks, eliminating the kinematic constraints
  that create complex and time-consuming motions in nonholonomic bases. We equip our
  robot with an intuitive mobile phone teleoperation interface to enable easy data
  acquisition for imitation learning. In our experiments, we use this interface to
  collect data and show that the resulting learned policies can successfully perform
  a variety of common household mobile manipulation tasks.
