title: 'RoboPoint: A Vision-Language Model for Spatial Affordance Prediction in Robotics'
abstract: 'From rearranging objects on a table to putting groceries into shelves,
  robots must plan precise action points to perform tasks accurately and reliably.
  In spite of the recent adoption of vision language models (VLMs) to control robot
  behavior, VLMs struggle to precisely articulate robot actions using language. We
  introduce an automatic synthetic data generation pipeline that instruction-tunes
  VLMs to robotic domains and needs. Using the pipeline, we train RoboPoint, a VLM
  that predicts image keypoint affordances given language instructions. Compared to
  alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world data collection or human
  demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse environments and viewpoints.
  In addition, RoboPoint is a general model that enables several downstream applications
  such as robot navigation, manipulation, and augmented reality (AR) assistance. Our
  experiments demonstrate that RoboPoint outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o)
  and visual prompting techniques (PIVOT) by 21.8% in the accuracy of predicting spatial
  affordance and by 30.5% in the success rate of downstream tasks. Anonymous project
