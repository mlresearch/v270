title: A Dual Approach to Imitation Learning from Observations with Offline Datasets
abstract: Demonstrations are an effective alternative to task specification for learning
  agents in settings where designing a reward function is difficult. However, demonstrating
  expert behavior in the action space of the agent becomes unwieldy when robots have
  complex, unintuitive morphologies. We consider the practical setting where an agent
  has a dataset of prior interactions with the environment and is provided with observation-only
  expert demonstrations. Typical learning from observations approaches have required
  either learning an inverse dynamics model or a discriminator as intermediate steps
  of training. Errors in these intermediate one-step models compound during downstream
  policy learning or deployment. We overcome these limitations by directly learning
  a multi-step utility function that quantifies how each action impacts the agent’s
  divergence from the expert’s visitation distribution. Using the principle of duality,
  we derive DILO (Dual Imitation Learning from Observations), an algorithm that can
  leverage arbitrary suboptimal data to learn imitating policies without requiring
  expert actions. DILO reduces the learning from observations problem to that of simply
  learning an actor and a critic, bearing similar complexity to vanilla offline RL.
  This allows DILO to gracefully scale to high dimensional observations, and demonstrate
  improved performance across the board.
