title: General Flow as Foundation Affordance for Scalable Robot Learning
abstract: 'We address the challenge of acquiring real-world manipulation skills with
  a scalable framework. We hold the belief that identifying an appropriate prediction
  target capable of leveraging large-scale datasets is crucial for achieving efficient
  and universal learning. Therefore, we propose to utilize 3D flow, which represents
  the future trajectories of 3D points on objects of interest, as an ideal prediction
  target. To exploit scalable data resources, we turn our attention to human videos.
  We develop, for the first time, a language-conditioned 3D flow prediction model
  directly from large-scale RGBD human video datasets. Our predicted flow offers actionable
  guidance, thus facilitating zero-shot skill transfer in real-world scenarios. We
  deploy our method with a policy based on closed-loop flow prediction. Remarkably,
  without any in-domain finetuning, our method achieves an impressive 81% success
  rate in zero-shot human-to-robot skill transfer, covering 18 tasks in 6 scenes.
  Our framework features the following benefits: (1) scalability: leveraging cross-embodiment
  data resources; (2) wide application: multiple object categories, including rigid,
  articulated, and soft bodies; (3) stable skill transfer: providing actionable guidance
  with a small inference domain-gap.'
