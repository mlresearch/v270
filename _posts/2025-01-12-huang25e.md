title: '3D-ViTac: Learning Fine-Grained Manipulation with Visuo-Tactile Sensing'
abstract: Tactile and visual perception are both crucial for humans to perform fine-grained
  interactions with their environment. Developing similar multi-modal sensing capabilities
  for robots can significantly enhance and expand their manipulation skills. This
  paper introduces **3D-ViTac**, a multi-modal sensing and learning system designed
  for dexterous bimanual manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped
  with dense sensing units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost
  and flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts, effectively
  complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual data, we fuse
  them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their 3D structures and
  spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can then be coupled with diffusion
  policies for imitation learning. Through concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate
  that even low-cost robots can perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform
  vision-only policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing
  long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation. Our project page is available
