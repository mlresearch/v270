title: 'Scaling Cross-Embodied Learning: One Policy for Manipulation, Navigation,
  Locomotion and Aviation'
abstract: Modern machine learning systems rely on large datasets to attain broad generalization,
  and this often poses a challenge in robotic learning, where each robotic platform
  and task might have only a small dataset. By training a single policy across many
  different kinds of robots, a robotic learning method can leverage much broader and
  more diverse datasets, which in turn can lead to better generalization and robustness.
  However, training a single policy on multi-robot data is challenging because robots
  can have widely varying sensors, actuators, and control frequencies. We propose
  CrossFormer, a scalable and flexible transformer-based policy that can consume data
  from any embodiment. We train CrossFormer on the largest and most diverse dataset
  to date, 900K trajectories across 20 different robot embodiments. We demonstrate
  that the same network weights can control vastly different robots, including single
  and dual arm manipulation systems, wheeled robots, quadcopters, and quadrupeds.
  Unlike prior work, our model does not require manual alignment of the observation
  or action spaces. Extensive experiments in the real world show that our method matches
  the performance of specialist policies tailored for each embodiment, while also
  significantly outperforming the prior state of the art in cross-embodiment learning.
