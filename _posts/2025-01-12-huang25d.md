title: 'VIRL: Self-Supervised Visual Graph Inverse Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Learning dense reward functions from unlabeled videos for reinforcement
  learning exhibits scalability due to the vast diversity and quantity of video resources.
  Recent works use visual features or graph abstractions in videos to measure task
  progress as rewards, which either deteriorate in unseen domains or capture spatial
  information while overlooking visual details. We propose $\textbf{V}$isual-Graph
  $\textbf{I}$nverse $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning (VIRL), a self-supervised
  method that synergizes low-level visual features and high-level graph abstractions
  from frames to graph representations for reward learning. VIRL utilizes a visual
  encoder that extracts object-wise features for graph nodes and a graph encoder that
  derives properties from graphs constructed from detected objects in each frame.
  The encoded representations are enforced to align videos temporally and reconstruct
  in-scene objects. The pretrained visual graph encoder is then utilized to construct
  a dense reward function for policy learning by measuring latent distances between
  current frames and the goal frame. Our empirical evaluation on the X-MAGICAL and
  Robot Visual Pusher benchmark demonstrates that VIRL effectively handles tasks necessitating
  both granular visual attention and broader global feature consideration, and exhibits
  robust generalization to $\textit{extrapolation}$ tasks and domains not seen in
  demonstrations. Our policy for the robotic task also achieves the highest success
  rate in real-world robot experiments.
