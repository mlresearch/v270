title: Uncertainty-Aware Decision Transformer for Stochastic Driving Environments
abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy learning without active
  interactions, making it especially appealing for self-driving tasks. Recent successes
  of Transformers inspire casting offline RL as sequence modeling, which, however,
  fails in stochastic environments with incorrect assumptions that identical actions
  can consistently achieve the same goal. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE
  deciSion Transformer (UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without
  introducing additional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST
  estimates uncertainties by conditional mutual information between transitions and
  returns. Discovering ’uncertainty accumulation’ and ’temporal locality’ properties
  of driving environments, we replace the global returns in decision transformers
  with truncated returns less affected by environments to learn from actual outcomes
  of actions rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate uncertainty
  at inference for cautious planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate UNREST’s superior
  performance in various driving scenarios and the power of our uncertainty estimation
  strategy.
