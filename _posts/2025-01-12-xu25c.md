title: 'VLM-Grounder: A VLM Agent for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding'
abstract: 3D visual grounding is crucial for robots, requiring integration of natural
  language and 3D scene understanding. Traditional methods depend on supervised learning
  with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods
  leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these
  methods often miss detailed scene context, limiting their ability to handle complex
  queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language
  models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder
  dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to
  find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately
  estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder
  outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and
  48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors.
