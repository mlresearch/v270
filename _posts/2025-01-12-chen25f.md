title: Object-Centric Dexterous Manipulation from Human Motion Data
abstract: 'Manipulating objects to achieve desired goal states is a basic but important
  skill for dexterous manipulation. Human hand motions demonstrate proficient manipulation
  capability, providing valuable data for training robots with multi-finger hands.
  Despite this potential, substantial challenges arise due to the embodiment gap between
  human and robot hands. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical policy learning
  framework that uses human hand motion data for training object-centric dexterous
  robot manipulation. At the core of our method is a high-level trajectory generative
  model, learned with a large-scale human hand motion capture dataset, to synthesize
  human-like wrist motions conditioned on the desired object goal states. Guided by
  the generated wrist motions, deep reinforcement learning is further used to train
  a low-level finger controller that is grounded in the robotâ€™s embodiment to physically
  interact with the object to achieve the goal. Through extensive evaluation across
  10 household objects, our approach not only demonstrates superior performance but
  also showcases generalization capability to novel object geometries and goal states.
  Furthermore, we transfer the learned policies from simulation to a real-world bimanual
  dexterous robot system, further demonstrating its applicability in real-world scenarios.
