title: Bimanual Dexterity for Complex Tasks
abstract: 'To train generalist robot policies, machine learning methods often require
  a substantial amount of expert human teleoperation data. An ideal robot for humans
  collecting data is one that closely mimics them: bimanual arms and dexterous hands.
  However, creating such a bimanual teleoperation system with over 50 DoF is a significant
  challenge. To address this, we introduce Bidex, an extremely dexterous, low-cost,
  low-latency and portable bimanual dexterous teleoperation system which relies on
  motion capture gloves and teacher arms. We compare Bidex to a Vision Pro teleoperation
  system and a SteamVR system and find Bidex to produce better quality data for more
  complex tasks at a faster rate. Additionally, we show Bidex operating a mobile bimanual
  robot for in the wild tasks. Please refer to https://bidex-teleop.github.io for
  video results and instructions to recreate Bidex. The robot hands (5k USD) and teleoperation
  system (7k USD) is readily reproducible and can be used on many robot arms including
  two xArms ($16k USD).'
