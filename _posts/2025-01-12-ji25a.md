title: 'GraspSplats: Efficient Manipulation with 3D Feature Splatting'
abstract: The ability for robots to perform efficient and zero-shot grasping of object
  parts is crucial for practical applications and is becoming prevalent with recent
  advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To bridge the 2D-to-3D gap for representations
  to support such a capability, existing methods rely on neural fields (NeRFs) via
  differentiable rendering or point-based projection methods. However, we demonstrate
  that NeRFs are inappropriate for scene changes due to its implicitness and point-based
  methods are inaccurate for part localization without rendering-based optimization.
  To amend these issues, we propose GraspSplats. Using depth supervision and a novel
  reference feature computation method, GraspSplats can generate high-quality scene
  representations under 60 seconds. We further validate the advantages of Gaussian-based
  representation by showing that the explicit and optimized geometry in GraspSplats
  is sufficient to natively support (1) real-time grasp sampling and (2) dynamic and
  articulated object manipulation with point trackers. With extensive experiments
  on a Franka robot, we demonstrate that GraspSplats significantly outperforms existing
  methods under diverse task settings. In particular, GraspSplats outperforms NeRF-based
  methods like F3RM and LERF-TOGO, and 2D detection methods. The code will be released.
