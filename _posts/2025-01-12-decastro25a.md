title: 'Dreaming to Assist: Learning to Align with Human Objectives for Shared Control
  in High-Speed Racing'
abstract: Tight coordination is required for effective human-robot teams in domains
  involving fast dynamics and tactical decisions, such as multi-car racing. In such
  settings, robot teammates must react to cues of a human teammate’s tactical objective
  to assist in a way that is consistent with the objective (e.g., navigating left
  or right around an obstacle). To address this challenge, we present _Dream2Assist_,
  a framework that combines a rich world model able to infer human objectives and
  value functions, and an assistive agent that provides appropriate expert assistance
  to a given human teammate. Our approach builds on a recurrent state space model
  to explicitly infer human intents, enabling the assistive agent to select actions
  that align with the human and enabling a fluid teaming interaction. We demonstrate
  our approach in a high-speed racing domain with a population of synthetic human
  drivers pursuing mutually exclusive objectives, such as “stay-behind” and “overtake”.
  We show that the combined human-robot team, when blending its actions with those
  of the human, outperforms synthetic humans alone and several baseline assistance
  strategies, and that intent-conditioning enables adherence to human preferences
  during task execution, leading to improved performance while satisfying the human’s
  objective.
