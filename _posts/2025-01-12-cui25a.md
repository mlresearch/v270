title: Adapting Humanoid Locomotion over Challenging Terrain via Two-Phase Training
abstract: Humanoid robots are a key focus in robotics, with their capacity to navigate
  tough terrains being essential for many uses. While strides have been made, creating
  adaptable locomotion for complex environments is still tough. Recent progress in
  learning-based systems offers hope for robust legged locomotion, but challenges
  persist, such as tracking accuracy at high speeds and on uneven ground, and joint
  oscillations in actual robots. This paper proposes a novel training framework to
  address these challenges by employing a two-phase training paradigm with reinforcement
  learning. The proposed framework is further enhanced through the integration of
  command curriculum learning, refining the precision and adaptability of our approach.
  Additionally, we adapt DreamWaQ to our humanoid locomotion system and improve it
  to mitigate joint oscillations. Finally, we achieve the sim-to-real transfer of
  our method. A series of empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of
  our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.
