title: 'InstructNav: Zero-shot System for Generic Instruction Navigation in Unexplored
  Environment'
abstract: Enabling robots to navigate following diverse language instructions in unexplored
  environments is an attractive goal for human-robot interaction. However, this goal
  is challenging because different navigation tasks require different strategies.
  The scarcity of instruction navigation data hinders training an instruction navigation
  model with varied strategies. Therefore, previous methods are all constrained to
  one specific type of navigation instruction. In this work, we propose InstructNav,
  a generic instruction navigation system. InstructNav makes the first endeavor to
  handle various instruction navigation tasks without any navigation training or pre-built
  maps. To reach this goal, we introduce Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation (DCoN) to unify
  the planning process for different types of navigation instructions. Furthermore,
  we propose Multi-sourced Value Maps to model key elements in instruction navigation
  so that linguistic DCoN planning can be converted into robot actionable trajectories.
  With InstructNav, we complete the R2R-CE task in a zero-shot way for the first time
  and outperform many task-training methods. Besides, InstructNav also surpasses the
  previous SOTA method by 10.48% on the zero-shot Habitat ObjNav and by 86.34% on
  demand-driven navigation DDN. Real robot experiments on diverse indoor scenes further
  demonstrate our methodâ€™s robustness in coping with the environment and instruction
  variations.
