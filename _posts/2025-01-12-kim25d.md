title: 'T$^2$SQNet: A Recognition Model for Manipulating Partially Observed Transparent
  Tableware Objects'
abstract: Recognizing and manipulating transparent tableware from partial view RGB
  image observations is made challenging by the difficulty in obtaining reliable depth
  measurements of transparent objects. In this paper we present the Transparent Tableware
  SuperQuadric Network (T$^2$SQNet), a neural network model that leverages a family
  of newly extended deformable superquadrics to produce low-dimensional, instance-wise
  and accurate 3D geometric representations of transparent objects from partial views.
  As a byproduct and contribution of independent interest, we also present TablewareNet,
  a publicly available toolset of seven parametrized shapes based on our extended
  deformable superquadrics, that can be used to generate new datasets of tableware
  objects of diverse shapes and sizes. Experiments with T$^2$SQNet trained with TablewareNet
  show that T$^2$SQNet outperforms existing methods in recognizing transparent objects,
  in some cases by significant margins, and can be effectively used in robotic applications
  like decluttering and target retrieval.
